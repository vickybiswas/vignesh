        "content": "@9:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)let's get on to yes yes right so I went through this very well shared out great a few questions that I've had put it for this one I hear a lot about co-pilates and I've created my fair share of them and I hear a lot about what you say about putting that these are the two main things that you have basically really got a lot of benefits out of but what tangy which would you say is like this is the best thing that I have still got\n\n@11:00 - Leo Rajapakse\nprofit and this is a tangible in dollar in in time in whatever will we can convert it to dollar in the end but this is that this is the kind of benefit that I've got and tangibly this is what I'm seeing in my company right now yeah so for example around 2018 we kind of did a AI version of would say a more intelligent version of our demand forecasting application so bimba beggars we are in the business of baking bread right big goods including number of biscuits we'll cut you there sorry about that our focus would be on genuine this would be yeah okay okay so okay so I was talking about\ndemand focusing. from a generous standpoint, we looked at things like, you know, creating toner designs through genia, right, is one of the use cases.\nAnd some of the integrity challenges that we got is, for example, if we use technologies such as Adobe Firefly, then the IP of the genia generated image belongs to Firefly.\nSo, we need to use software ensuring that the particular IP belongs to us. So, that is one case.\n\n@12:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think that is, are you not using the diffusion models which basically pretty much give you the right energy?\nYeah, yeah.\n\n@13:00 - Leo Rajapakse\nhere we have using some models which are hosted on our estate, that's what we're doing. And also we created a bunch of, I would say, local versions of GPT kind of elements where we are hosting our compliance documents as well as a cloud policy cloud-based documents so that people can go and have a conversational interface into that some of the data, data analytics teams are doing similar activities as well.\nwe are also using Azure OpenAI interfaces into, I would say, the IT based technologies as such as well. So those are some of the things that we are doing using JNI.\nI got four things new.\n\n@14:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOne, I got about the total design. Second, I got about the compliance cloud policy. mean, basically, I'm reading a rack chatbot over this so that people can ask questions and get answers.\nThird, I understood data analytics. would like to go deeper into it. the fourth, I understood Azure Open AI chat, but for what?\ncouldn't understand that.\n\n@14:37 - Leo Rajapakse\nSo think of it as Azure Open. Now, I mentioned about we hosting our own elements, right, private elements. Azure Open AI is something of that sort, hosting, but it's, but Microsoft is hosting it and Microsoft\nas an interface, API-based interface, the X-Force source that we can use, right?\n\n@15:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nShould I assume that this is also a part of the compliance cloud policy, rag-based chatbot that you have been creating and this is a part of that, isn't it?\n\n@15:18 - Leo Rajapakse\nNo, it's kind of something that we use for different different projects. I would say it's like a tool that we can use for different projects.\nOh, it's like think of it as a GVD, we can go and apply it in different different areas, like something like that, and also some of the other applications of Lillelens is when training datasets also we use Lillelens sometimes.\nYeah data massaging in the sense let's say you have a output which is 95.6 accuracy. So we can actually use an LMLM to actually kind of figure out whether it's you know false reading or a true reading by by getting the LMLM involved.\nSo that is another area that we're using. How is the evaluation? I understand correctly.\n\n@16:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah.\n\n@16:38 - Leo Rajapakse\nSo I was talking about copilot right so apart from the O36 where copilot how to clear it down and which also gives the most benefit because it's used by the masses right.\n\n@16:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe got we\n\n@17:00 - Leo Rajapakse\nThis is the Microsoft security copilot, so we use Microsoft, some of the Microsoft's security stack which is like a sentinel seam security incident and event management where you push bunch of logs and based on the logs, it will analyze it and look at potential vulnerabilities and threats and make recommendations.\nWhen you have the copilot, you can go and ask questions like, what are the most highest vulnerabilities, what actions do we need to take, so it will you that like 60% more productivity.\nSo a SOC analyst is what is seen. The third part about it is how the pricing model works from Microsoft perspective.\nThey have a complex model of how they would allocate. So it's based usage of the copilot. So how they peel us is kind of dodgy.\nSo it's hard to kind of project.\n\n@18:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, I have I have built with them and I have I have worked with their API pricing and everything else.\nI would be I would be doing that part. But the part that I'm a bit wondering about is how do you calculate this 60% benefit because from what I understand the dodder design is still MPOC, right?\nWhen you talk about chatbot and copilates, which are basically giving your compliance for policies, etc, that is, I mean, how do you calculate the ROI to be around 60% better?\nWhen you talk about data analytics and using your training data sets, you're massaging, evaluating all these things that you're doing.\nHow do you calculate your 60% benefit? So, what are the types of data? How are they getting the benefit?\n\n@19:27 - Leo Rajapakse\nOkay, so when I would say 60% benefit from the Microsoft copilot is the soft analyst's job. His effort is much less than without a copilot.\n\n@19:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nDoes that mean that it takes 60% less time?\n\n@19:49 - Leo Rajapakse\nHow do you translate that into an activity that takes 60% less time for them to do the same thing, right?\nAnd when you... Look at the 0.365 co-pilot that too is productivity. You take less time to do the same job as supposed to, mean, it's more pronounced in BIMBO because we have a fairly large Mexican headcount and their English is not as fluent as India or some other countries.\nSo, having a co-pilot means that they can now fluent, write emails, documents, lot of things. So, their productivity is definitely enhanced through the use of.\nSo, I would say that quality of work probably has improved on that.\n\n@20:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow do you help productivity increase in this one?\n\n@20:54 - Leo Rajapakse\nSo, basically what you saying is how do I\n\n@21:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nactually measure and I'll tell you this is the basic problem that I'm facing across lot of different companies and the problem is that we do put up that hey I mean I am getting a lot of effort from Jenny yeah but when we start to angibly boil it down hey how are we getting that benefit are we able to I mean are we are we able to reduce health counts are we able to do more work then we were doing are we able to do faster work than we were doing right and then that's the 60% gets a bit murky and then we have to define it down further and yes there are benefits but angibly defining those benefits is the key yeah so did we reduce head count yes we reduced I mean we reduced 50 million dollars worth of US head count which is 350 people I wouldn't say that you know that is\n\n@22:00 - Leo Rajapakse\njust because we put co-pilot and just because we have jet air but we did a massive heat count reduction as well.\nSo I think if you are really interested in looking at productivity at a granular level, one option is to try and use a DEX digital experience product.\nThere is a number of products out there. It will go and look at the productivity in different ways. will either look at the different applications and the usage and how your environments are performing, much of a laptop is being used or not used.\nSo DEX is one Avenue if you want to go into look into productivity at that brand new level So basically in terms of let us say BIMBO would we say that hey after Jenny I was certain because of Jenny I was able to get a 60% hit on my bottom line top line any one of these I couldn't say that because our sales figures have gone down right so even if we even if our productivity goes up if our sales figures go down I won't say sales figures went down so we had very huge ambitions we had that ambition to go from a 20 billion company to a 25 billion company in five years so our target kept going higher and higher but the sales\n\n@24:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean back to Jenny I mean out of all these that we discussed the donor design we discussed the chart board hope tell it with compliance etcetera We not sure what exactly that they we are basically using it for using using use of the pool for multiple things Maybe language is one of them right and then you talked about Being using sent in the scene for security and other things right.\nWhat is the maximum ROI? We have bought out of any one of these which only which is number one.\nThis is my number one go do for recommending anybody that hey Jenny I should be used you\n\n@25:04 - Leo Rajapakse\nI don't, I can't recall anything with a quantifiable outcome which was, I mean, which we actually calculated the dollar values in outcome, but we can do those calculations based on, you know, productive days, but, you know, there was no single project which we can say just because we did JNI, this much value came out.\nBut then again, that is, those numbers are monkey when it comes to whole of data analytics. it is.\n\n@25:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAll right.\n\n@25:46 - Leo Rajapakse\nWhy are we paying this much for data analytics? What is the ROI of data analytics? I haven't come across a data analytics department which can give the cost of KPI.\nCharge back. or the show back of value of from the inputs to the cost to the product. I haven't come across what they all say usually is try not paying us and see what happens, obviously all the reports will be there for both.\nThat is also that I usually get, why not pay this because I didn't see what happens. No proper traceability into those, not just any a whole of the data analytics.\nYeah, that's normal. For general, any type of AI to happen, the first thing is you need to have clean data.\nClean data is a problem for a lot of people. Some people and say, I can be robust and I can work with some unclean, but end of the day, if you don't have three data, all your results go for six anyways.\n\n@27:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut there is another angle I have to do it. I'm sorry, this should not be a part of discussion again with us.\nI think we got liberty. I feel that many organizations are trying to take the key of JNI and find a lock that they want to unlock.\nInstead of picking a problem and then solving it with JNI, lot of different boards that I have talked to, we want to use JNI for what dude, what exactly do you want to achieve?\n\n@27:48 - Leo Rajapakse\nAI is at the top of the hype cycle. my view is just like the botany bubble, the AI bubble is going to happen.\n\n@27:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think it's already I think it's already there now.\n\n@28:04 - Leo Rajapakse\nAny startup, you just put the name AI, it will get a couple of million dollars, something extra. So people do it.\nSo everything is AI. if you cough, it's AI.\n\n@28:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's been over here.\n\n@28:21 - Leo Rajapakse\nfive, six years ago, everything was out. Even if you eat some sugar candy, sugar cloud. Yeah.\n\n@28:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo coming back on a tangible deal, I mean, is it, again, my, I'm repeating the question. Is that, is there any one project which you would say is given me the biggest benefit so far, and I would recommend everybody should be actually doing that.\nTangible biggest benefit that you would say in your opinion, again, if you don't take numbers. I believe,\n\n@29:00 - Leo Rajapakse\nif it's a single benefit and they should be using is definitely good yeah they should be using the the copilates like programming copilates.\nSome years ago we used to say you know everybody coding is coding used to be you you know look up some websites you know copy some code mash it up together and create your program now you know you just need to write the right lines to ask for the right code and it gets coded up so much easier obviously there's a process doesn't minus to the code that gets coded up but um that that can\nof helps the development cycle become much, much faster, right? And even the Office 365 base co-piles, even if you use, let's say Excel, you can just use natural language to do some, you know, serious calculations as well.\nSo those basic things is some of the things that I believe is the one thing I would say would give the most benefit.\nAt least in my team, what I try to do is I try to, so sometime ago in Google came maybe 2009, that year, everybody is using Google and, you know, people mastered Google, Google, Google, you know, Google.\nLike now, people will need to become prompt engineers. We will need to become a prompt engineer to get ahead.\nYeah. Yeah. that's what I'm trying to do, at least with my name. Yeah.\n\n@31:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, I have built a share of co-pilates, right? this was like, I started quite early about three years back.\nWe were able to deliver certain co-pilates two years. Many of that, we were building co-pilates for a lot of different companies, but it became very popular, right?\nPeople wanted to be in co-pilates, problem with co-pilates is that you see that a lot of people do not understand what exactly to extract out of the co-pilate.\nIf they know what to extract out of the co-pilate, then whether they have the right set of data to actually help out with that.\nAnd it's very easy to say we can throw a thing in a rag and give us answers. actually doesn't give you good answers.\nIf you need good answers, need to actually work a shitload on the way that manage that copilot, whether you are using a graph rack, you are using a rack, whether you are basically analyzing the responses that you are getting and then accumulating it or even there are a lot of final things within that.\nAnd copilates, though they get made, they get deployed, a lot of them are not actually giving the right ROI.\nRight. And the worst problem with that is people are not measuring the ROI also. Okay, before copilot, this was the benefit after copilot, this is what I'm getting.\nHow are you doing that in your organization right now?\n\n@32:38 - Leo Rajapakse\nWe are not actively measuring the benefits and to your question about the, you know, quality of data in the copilates, you might know the famous use case where a lawyer use a copilot and they use some cases as\nreferences and it's important to check the references and there was a startup that I knew I can't remember the name, they were using the data sources coming into the rag, they have a mechanism of kind of breaking down the level of trust of that particular source for example if it's coming in from Wall Street Journal it will have one level of trust, if it's going to that's a dark way but it'll have a different level of trust, they had a specific LLM with rags which had this you can go it's a it's a rabbit hole right now when it comes to different LLM.\n\n@34:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo if I would summarize this, say tangibly, we are not sure on where exactly AI is giving us benefits.\nI think, totally, we understand that in a lot of different places, it's adding on, right? To whatever benefits we are getting, it's adding on, it's giving us, it's tangibly, we are able to assume it's giving us but when to be very, very detailed and down into it, we are not sure what part of it can be attributed to Genia.\nIs that a correct understanding that you can take out of this? Correct.\n\n@34:38 - Leo Rajapakse\nYeah. Right.\n\n@34:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd if I would feel the question, what place do you feel it miserably feels? Oh, we try it out, but it miserably feels.\nWe have done our best to make it work when it just doesn't work.\n\n@34:55 - Leo Rajapakse\nWhat would be that? Genia.\n\n@34:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGenia.\n\n@34:59 - Leo Rajapakse\nYeah. I believe when it came to using digital twins, is where it kind of, because bakery is kind of a complex animal, you take one bakery, if you try to model each piece of equipment, the difference, source ingredients going into it and the different outputs that coming out of it, and if we try to model the digital twins of equipment, that's one area we kind of miserably flailed, I believe, complex problems that it didn't work in shop.\nWhat was the digital twin aim?\n\n@35:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I mean the children as many aims were, what was your aim in creating this digital twin?\n\n@36:00 - Leo Rajapakse\nReally if we have an entire digital twin version of a bakery, let's say we have like digital oven, we have a digital bin with a bun bagger, all those equipment, we can assemble and tune bakeries without actually physically assembling and tuning those bakeries.\nRight now when we go to certain bakeries, I just ask questions and I ask questions and when I ask questions on the which happened often.\nSo one set of people were saying when the bun bagger is stop working, the entire line needs to be shut down to allow the packing of bands.\nSo, the simple answer to the problem is you need to just double the one bag is. So, if some fail the others will still work right.\nSo, if it didn't work, I mean our intention of going to the baker is not visit. I was just in a mining around for problems.\nSo, if we have proper detail to in versions, we would actually be able to see these problems more proactively as supposed to.\nWhich is a great idea, but what did it not? I mean, this is not the only a genuine problem.\n\n@37:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is basically a problem where you need to collect data and then have a let's say a software version of basically your bakery that was and you can\nAnalyze that, right? Now, this is a beautiful idea that can be actually implemented and worked well. What was the challenge in this book?\n\n@38:10 - Leo Rajapakse\nSo, get into, if you take the manufacturing industry, in the manufacturing industry itself collects less than 10 percent of the data.\nWe grew through acquisition, each paper is different, having different models of equipment and some are old, some are new, so different interfaces.\nSo, it's similar problem to the healthcare industry, right? It's, they do not date their equipment all the time. got legacy equipment and some of the control systems that they run are running on windows, you know, windows XP or something like that.\nSo, you get these legacy environments because of those differences, yeah, you don't get all that information. Okay, okay, that's it, that's it.\n\n@39:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nimportant to solve that's a good one to solve yeah and and why why did we use genie i into this i mean this is the this is a big problem which has many aspects what aspect does genie i solve in this in where in in the district with part i believe i can't remember exactly okay no one is yeah what is on that i think we are already running short of time we have four minutes left one quick question that i wanted to put forward before this is if somebody is let's say coming to you for genie i advice right what would be your talk to do and talk to do not\n\n@40:00 - Leo Rajapakse\nlearn from engineering and see how you could apply JNAI to your industry or to your day-to-day life to make something better and talk to things to not do is obviously there's an ethical part of JNAI right you can seriously use JNAI especially there are certain models which don't have ethical capabilities built-in so which can be used for cyber security hacking and all kinds of you you know things that that you can do so that's another area that I would recommend people not to use it against and next one is\nDo not use an AI in the weapons technology. Can you elaborate a bit on that?\n\n@41:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe'll elaborate on weapons technology.\n\n@41:14 - Leo Rajapakse\nwill not use it.\n\n@41:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe will not do all that. Without thinking of are a lot of people using it in the wrong places.\nThis is right now.\n\n@41:31 - Leo Rajapakse\nOne of my friends, he was contracting to I think semantic. Semantic was contracting to every government. Okay. he designed the algorithm for the cluster bomb.\nSo basically these bombs, when you throw these cluster bombs, go in, you know, plot themselves. And if one cluster bomb goes, the other one\na customer becomes sensitive and they turn towards the one which went out. they cannot know the people are coming from that way.\nOkay. So, if you properly use AI technology and considering that, you know, quite a bit of the Ukraine voice is having drones, you combine these technologies, you know, there would not be a planet or there would a lot more work that.\n\n@42:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTotally agree, totally agree, totally agree. And one last question, Leo, is how can people actually understand that I'm investing into JNI and I'm getting this return?\nBecause a big problem, a big, big problem and this is across the industry is people are not able to very clearly understand their ROI on whatever they are doing on JNI.\nSome murky number, which is like very rosy, but when you get down into details, we are not able to pinpoint, we are not able to get through.\nis your recommendation on getting the right understanding of the ROI? we are investing, right? All of us are investing.\nHow do we get the right?\n\n@43:20 - Leo Rajapakse\nCorporate things, one is obviously have a business case. A business case might have some nice samples, yes? But then after the business case, you should do a proof of, you know, proof of concept, proof of value to show that you are actually reaping the value and getting the benefits before you do a, you know, full scale deployment or transformation or build.\nSo based on the proof of value, then then go for bigger things is basically what I am saying. Got it.\n\n@43:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nit. Got it. quickly get the proof of the pudding before you start making more puddings.\n\n@44:06 - Leo Rajapakse\nYeah, yeah, and it's especially important especially when you use managed service providers, right? For example, I was in discussion with a particular managed service provider.\nThey were recommending for what we are doing, you should instead of using a large language model, you should use a small language model and they gave this fantastic presentation why we shouldn't use RAG, we should use a small language model.\nSo all these concepts verify with Gartner and Gartner comes back to me and says, the only company that we know who successfully did a small language model and train it is Goldman Sachs, everybody else failed.\nSo, So there's a lot of buzz, so we need to tread very carefully, especially because sometimes you may get a few individuals who will be able to actually make it work.\nBut you basically get a managed service provider, fund it for an idea and an outcome or how do we ensure the managed service provider actually delivers, even if it could be delivered, how do we ensure that it can be actually delivered?\nAnd also it's important to measure the cost, ongoing cost. For example, there was one use case where we were expecting to pay only $70,000 per month on that environment, they were going up to $200,000 a month on that environment.\nand sometimes it's difficult to limit it as well because they would come back and say hey we need this to you know do do the work otherwise we can't do it so it's it's very difficult to put a cap on the money but it's important to put a cap on the money otherwise yeah you spend a lot and you're not getting anything that's right because you you don't have a direction where you actually get to I mean you need to know the bottom of the pit before you jump in on that makes sense make sense thank you so much you know I think I've got all that I wanted for this interview it has sparked a lot of I think we should talk more this whenever we have time we have deli is it yeah I'm based on a deli okay if I'm coming that way I'll definitely giving you a shout shout shout shout shout give me a shout and I mean if I'm in you I'm definitely gonna give you a shout\n\n@47:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nright and if there is everything I can be helpful and ever in terms of whatever small amount of knowledge I have been able to gain I am always here for you just just a pick away okay so excellent thank you very much Vicki you have very much you so much for the time bye\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.

What we are trying to figure out is we are interviewing around 200 companies and we are trying to figure out, okay, I mean, on the onset, it looks great.\nmean, Thunky Dole, it's green, AI is coming with logical reasoning, AI is coming with a lot of other things and specifically in terms of generative AI.\nWe are not focusing on the the traditional AI. of stuff, right? Not in terms of fiction sector, just focused on generative AI and with all this hustle that's going around and everybody running around with generative AI.\n\n@2:10 - Priya Mohan\nWhat is the ground reality?\n\n@2:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIn terms of positives, in terms of negatives, and that's where basically I connected. Probably I can pick your brain, get some information and we can not be discussing around it.\n\n@2:23 - Priya Mohan\nThat's a pretext of this form. Sounds good. And is there any set of questions you want to guide or it's just an open conversation that you want to have?\n\n@2:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGenerally open conversation, but I share a list of questions which I will probably be using in my in my questionnaire.\nI mean, it's just a direction, not basically something that you need to or have to have to follow.\n\n@2:44 - Priya Mohan\nI see.\n\n@2:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@2:48 - Priya Mohan\nOkay. can let me just open that list.\n\n@2:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI can I can just browse through.\n\n@2:55 - Priya Mohan\ndon't have to be in the list. It's not required. Sure.\n\n@3:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, if you are ready, can get across and get this. Yeah.\n\n@3:04 - Priya Mohan\nSure.\n\n@3:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. So, to begin with, I mean, I understand that you are in the investment industry, so if for the sake of the interview, what industry and sector would be called by the company that you work with, we are very sector agnostic.\n\n@3:20 - Priya Mohan\nSo the way we think about it is two parts, which is building in India for intern building in India of the globe.\nAnd part of GC's thesis is also applied AI is something which we are very, very bullish on. And when I say applied AI, it is exactly the point that you are making, which is not so much about, you know, very top level stuff, but AI applications in day to day businesses and in turning around day to day consumer experience.\nAnd so think of our investment interest. as because there's the deep tech component and everything, but we're sector agnostic, we are industry agnostic, but we like businesses which are going to drive resilient industries for individual countries, given the whole geopolitical changes that are happening.\nAnd at a horizontal level, if I were to put a visual, we like applied AI, and we believe that it'll cut across many things over the period of time.\n\n@4:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI agree with that. That's a beautiful vision to go across. I'm very valid with what in my experience of 27 years.\nThat's great. So I mean, I would pick it at an investment industry where we are trying to invest and get other companies on board it, and the sector would probably be mostly towards building in India with applied AI.\nIs that fair to say that?\n\n@4:46 - Priya Mohan\nI mean, that's one of the focus. See, the other thing I want to clarify is Vicki, I'm assuming this is off the record, because one thing is our compliance might not allow any of this to go on record.\nI'm just having these open conversations. GC has a name, or we can't be quoted because we have this old because they're a regulated entity.\nWe have this old jazz. So I'm just assuming this is off record. See, so look, I think that's why I said there's deep tech in deep tech, you know, obviously we have investors in Mistral, which is building foundational, you know, in your foundational model.\nThen in the other side, you have, like I said, we invest from seed across stages, but we do a lot of creation opportunities.\nIn every one of those industries, we do not see how do you call it tech as separate. We really believe that applied AI, like I said, think of it like a horizontal that comes through everything.\nIt has to be contextualized for industries. That's it. Right. And it has to be abstracted for something which is very relevant.\nAnd again, there are two parts to it. One is sales enhancing touchpoint first kind of AI application layers where\nanything which actually directly changes customer experience, you know, customer buying behavior, you know, customer success. And the other thing is the AI that propels the whole other non-customer touch points, which is the backend and, you know, anything towards from a manufacturing company perspective, you can even talk about, you know, can you run, you know, at a very, very core level if it's specialty, chemical company, can you use AI for simulations of some of these molecular experiments before you actually bring it to R&D lab, to that extreme to actually building, you know, models or abstraction layers on top of edge computing sensors that you get from machines to actually start predicting, you know, capex and productivity and everything.\nAnd on the other side, if you take health, there's a great example which is like radiologists, neuroses, et cetera, such shortage.\nHow do you use, you know, AI model? to actually help augment and expand and that is a beautiful example because there it's a direct ROI for a business it it solves for a ratio of applied to customers and it also does revenue enhancement right like because if the nurses are only like say there's one nurse for every 100 patients and today with AI one nurse can deal with 300 patients that's a beautiful example same thing with radiologists so that's how about it that's right that's right great so when I can totally relate to this because I've been I have one of my contracts was with the point medical in us which we were building cancer detection machines using AI which was doing esophageal cancer figuring out so that was I mean one of the projects and I totally understand I mean the way that you're putting this forward so it's mostly about applied AI it's about building in India and that's a specific focus and I understand right?\na rough company size in terms of employees and revenue and this is I mean you can deny to answer this it's absolutely fine this is just to understand the basics and I don't think there's a benchmark at all I mean we come so early there's like I don't think it's the right metric to say we invest like I said we are multi-stage so we don't know about the companies we invested about us as a company oh as but again to clarify we don't want to go on record so that's why I don't go on record that's what I mean I also mentioned when I talked earlier so yeah but I think you can take public sources right like we just raised an eight billion dollar fund and I don't know actually the number of employees I don't think we have that disclosure okay no worries that's absolutely fine um in terms of AI adoption in our own work and we are not talking about computer investing and right now it's it's about us right and that will be\nmost focus of this this conversation it will be how we are operating as a company ourselves not people we are investing in right now because we are trying to look at our usage and we how practically are we applying to what one thing is the kind of AI option level that we have as a company and that we are able to leverage for our benefit right now I think for me there are fundamentally I I'll talk about my thing personally actually as we are speaking I've just downloaded llama into my local machine to see how you know I can use it without internet actually deepseak has a huge storage issue so I didn't download and I abandoned it but look for me the first thing that changed my life is literally I've been working on my prompts which are GPT publicity and everything because you know there's a lot of thinking that you do when you're contextualizing investment decisions you are you are like you know correlating data and everything today it's so easy I can literally write an entire investment\nmore and save my thoughts to just the perspectives, right? So I don't have to sit in waste time thinking about and making those sentences and everything.\nSo let's say I'm evaluating a company which is a B2B market season speciality chemicals, I will just say, you know, the it's beautiful because the quality of a question is your quality of answers, right?\nLike so it's in that way you really think about, you know, tell me for example, you know, the, you know, the movement in public markets with respect to chemicals in the last 10 years, what has been the top macro tailwinds, you know, how much of this has become indigenized.\nIt's like having your own analyst, otherwise it's like based on considering and doing, you know, the whole internet search.\n\n@10:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's something which is a very basic thing that I use, right?\n\n@10:47 - Priya Mohan\nBut research and memory in basically that's one of my building, literally everything in terms of any external communication I use, charge your PD to help me.\nThen we also have our own CRM and we are trying to build not build anything which is like how do you we are trying to think about how to use AI on data of company evaluation and company sourcing also right like how do you use and founder speedings right like we've not built anything but that's something that we are ourselves thinking and i'm working on but these are something that i have worked on for esw capitals mergers and acquisitions so they have a first level of automated AI based evaluation where you get all the company data and the balance sheet and all the financial and the other data and then you put it in you can have a little level work through so that was a very beautiful exercise that i did about one and a half years ago it will be a very interesting journey for you as well yeah it's going to be a beautiful one i'd love to pick your brains what you build and it'll be good to if you can duplicate some of the things that we can have a separate conversation but this is what we are trying to do right so this is this is great now what i understand is we are going to do research\n\n@12:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbuild memo and that's in general what we are trying to do right now right not really I think that is very very is that's not even like a point of consideration what we really want to build is a product for sourcing companies evaluating companies bringing that in foundation sorry I'm currently talking about what we are using currently what what we want to build that that discussion of a minute we can probably have that sometime there we can spend some time and focus on that well it's already yeah yeah it's already on works is what I'm saying okay all right I'll get your point so that again would probably count as maybe the search and first level decision making right yeah sort of what else I mean are we using it in areas like HR in in process in operations that I can't answer because I don't know like I'm talking only about the investment team I really don't know not have I done some interviews as to how the other guys do it\n\n@13:00 - Priya Mohan\nBut I'm sure like GC is a very tech for the kind of people. I'm sure it has a wide range usage.\n\n@13:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's basically one of the considerations because when we are trying to understand the usage of AI in a company, what we are trying to understand is in what areas of the company is it touching?\nIs it touching the culture? mean, how are we handling the culture, right? So, I mean, are we promoting our teams?\nYou guys should go and save a number of your time and use AI to get me the results. Or, hey, I don't care how you get me the results, right?\nAs long as the results are going, you use AI or not with your provider. So, that's the culture side of things, right?\nThen you have processes. mean, are we building in AI into our processes? Hey, for the first level, the the wedding has to be done by the AI, right?\nThe second is probably will be done by humans and so on. So, this is the kind of thing that I'm looking at in current process.\n\n@13:55 - Priya Mohan\nthink it's a great question, but I think it's very individual driven. see uh investing is still a very it's very hard to institutionalize investing in the sense of course you have certain degree you have i see but how each person say for example there are many investors who look at consumer tech businesses or b2b marketplace or traditional businesses the way they interact with ai and build that in their own is very different from say a very savvy tech investor sitting out of the silicon valley right like so i think it's a very individual thing i i don't think we've reached a stage where there's a certain standardized set which is what we are aiming to we've actually brought in and co to actually create these tools which can be like horizontal and building uh as far as the culture goes i think one of the things we do a lot is dialogue which is like we we actually spend time discussing on all the latest things but i'll be honest with you i think a dialogue is is a lot more theoretical i mean you can sound smart but actually when i'm downloading this in my machine and playing around with it what i learn is far 10x from just you know\nthings, two, three smart lines about Deepseek or something. I think we, I think a lot, I would say we are a lot ahead of many other funds.\nI would say you should actually, the guys were actually doing this by the way, Deepseek came from a quant guy, right?\nI think the hedge funds or the real, like those guys, I'm assuming they leverage this a lot. Because there's less quality to information and there's a lot of quantitative, steady state information that they can actually leverage and maneuver.\n\n@15:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right. That's right. So, I mean, in terms of process, are we, are we mandating AI or are we getting it as an optional quality ad if they want to?\ndon't care. don't, we don't, I don't think we can mandate, I don't think we've mandated anything. Okay. Okay. And in terms of culture, so I mean, let us say, I mean, if you are not mandating,\nHow are we trying to educate and push what is our strategy in making our people actually go and start?\n\n@16:06 - Priya Mohan\nLike said, we discuss a lot, yeah, like we have India, US and European teams and there's a ton of dialogue and there are really, and we do a lot of work in the frontier tech like our connections to South up and tier, like we have invested in some of the best companies these health sing, Andrew, Lestral, like we have ex googlers, have ex llama guys, have ex meta guys, open AI, I think we are in the forefront of speaking to these experts.\n\n@16:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo there's a ton of dialogue. Are we really using it in our operations currently, right now, as we speak, in the operations?\n\n@16:44 - Priya Mohan\nThat's what I said. I think, I think like we are building and like I can't talk about it too much, we're actually building those tools as we speak now.\n\n@16:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGet the point. And when we are building these tools and again, I mean, you can choose not to answer on those.\nAre we focusing? on just our operations, just the HR side of things towards the technology infrastructure side of things towards, hey, am I my core business, right?\nAm I putting my core business stuff into it? What is it that we are aspiring AI to do for us right now?\nWhat is our aspiration and what is generating our deliver to us?\n\n@17:22 - Priya Mohan\nI think it will cut across everything, including like I said, right from sourcing companies to evaluating companies to actually creating founder experience and we cutting across everything.\n\n@17:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd I mean, I'll let us put it in this way. It is going to cut across sourcing and all this, but what is my priority?\nWhat would I probably take further? That would be very hard for me to answer.\n\n@17:45 - Priya Mohan\nIt'd be very theoretical if I did that's like a firm. I wear a very large firm, right? Like me sitting here, I don't think I can give you a strategic answer on that because it's in the process, right?\nThere's a lot we thought too for that.\n\n@17:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, and that's still something that's already in the development phases or in the process of thought and I'm still figuring out on those.\n\n@18:06 - Priya Mohan\nWe have a team that is figuring that out at a centralized level, so yeah.\n\n@18:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so let me let me then change the way that we're going to talk about this. Let's just move on to a card where we say, hey, when we talk about generative AI and we have missed all that investing in and their llama and others that we are using and try GPT is what we are using.\nWhat is the best tangible benefit that GC has as yet got from generative?\n\n@18:38 - Priya Mohan\nAnd how would you, how would you substantiate it or how would you say it's I think tangible benefit is actually identifying companies and investing in them.\nSee, I think I'll tell you where the problem is. I think the investing world is a very nuanced world wiki.\nthink the kind of answers you're expecting. I think it'll be very hard to bring that into a investment. fund, especially a qualitative investment fund like us, which behaves like a Sequoia and a 16 Z versus a quant base hedge fund kind of a thing, a public markets investor, the kind of data and the thing that you do is a different.\nSo what I'm thinking is how meaningful can I, I think a lot of the answers I'll be giving to is very repetitive, right?\nLike I don't think our business is to identify companies, talk to founders, invest in them and help them grow.\nUm, so it's going to be hard to no one saying, where can I apply API in my businesses?\n\n@19:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nDo you understand what I'm saying? So what I understand is that we want to use generative AI, but for now it is not actually being used on ground.\nWe are working on building that, but that's not being used on ground.\n\n@19:45 - Priya Mohan\nIs that, but that's what I'm trying to push you on ground for like up business is different, right? Like if you're talking to a manufacturing company to say, Hey, are you using generative AI with certain examples, it makes sense.\nWe are a business of investment. don't know how whatever answer I give how like can I take ultimately my job is to deploy dollars in company like I've told you again I've done the sourcing part I've done all of that we are thinking about it and we are enhancing it and everything right and I told you like it's touching like a memo writing but ultimately our business is dollar deployment and expanding returns and it's very qualitative and nuanced so I'm not sure the the answer will be as satisfactory as looking at it as any other business that's what I'm trying to say any answer is satisfactory for me because we understand and this is a general rule that yeah people talk about AI there's a lot of AI and this is how it started right but not a lot of it is being practically used or usable right it goes both ways that's absolutely fine just part of the interview and we understand that it might not be but that's what I was pushing back to say that\nnot used in the context of what in our business, in GC, not just GC, any investing fund. If I were like, I use AI in my personal public markets investment.\nI'm constantly prompting the machine to understand, me this is my IRR and everything. But my business in GC as an investor is a very qualitative business.\nI use problems and everything. I'm not sure that when you say generative AI, let's take an extreme case. Can we let go of investors and generative AI, identify companies and throw money in that?\ndon't think that's a possibility of business like ours. a very nuanced people, dependent, very relationship-first thing. So that's what I'm trying to tell you that I don't.\n\n@21:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI don't really share my experience on the GC part of the investment part of the thing that I am working on.\nMy scope was very limited in my way of working, but I'll just share that across. as I said, the BPMW capitals and this is not properly trained, we have to share it with you.\nYeah, of course. Being a part of the technical innovation team, we were able to build solutions for M&S, which were basically your AI and a generative AI, these tools, which could actually, as I said, earlier, take all the documents, do a first level of finding, fact finding, and I'm finding and giving you a first thumbs up with, hey, this looks like something that I want to invest in, or it doesn't look like something that I want to invest in.\n\n@22:37 - Priya Mohan\nThat's what I'm saying, but documents, what?\n\n@22:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThese are public markets, right?\n\n@22:41 - Priya Mohan\nYeah, but that's not relevant for me. I don't do public market investing.\n\n@22:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's why I'm trying to... they are more of a private investor where they might not take a public firm, or they might take a public firm either way, in both ways, where they would probably get the documents of the company or whatever is running or the financial statements or whatever data.\n\n@24:00 - Priya Mohan\nYou are saying very basic still.\n\n@24:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, right. And so, let us, we have our operations. do step one, step two, step three. have, we have our processes in place, right?\nIs there any part of this process that you feed in today that, hey, I can put in AI, generative AI into this, this process, this step I can remove and properly put, or is it no, not right now?\n\n@24:23 - Priya Mohan\nYes, still.\n\n@24:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLook what I told you, Ricky.\n\n@24:25 - Priya Mohan\nare working exactly on that. We are actually putting through this and our team is working on that.\n\n@24:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. Okay. Cool. I understand that. And in terms of usage too far, right? And since you have been using it personally and with other aspects, is there something that you feed it is not able to handle?\nWhen I tried my best, I tried to give it whatever I put, but AI is not ready to do this.\nI hear you, when I hear that, hey, can I allow it to do my personal communication with the founder than everybody, no, I cannot.\nRight? What else?\n\n@24:59 - Priya Mohan\nI think that's the one. thing. I can't think of anything else because I think there's a very nuanced relationship based thing.\nA company is like, for example, I don't think AI can handle decisions on, it can give you mathematical decisions on, you know, follow on and all that.\nBut I don't think AI can handle nuanced decisions on taking certain, you know, bets. I don't even think we use that.\nSo let me be in all honesty. So, yeah.\n\n@25:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. mean, Adam, Max, what probably we can and others, you did this categorization before a human takes a decision, categorize these things for me.\nSo, I can pick up from there and I mean, I can take my decision, I can move on. Do you think it is really like even performing at that level right now or doing anything delivering anything like that for you right now?\n\n@25:44 - Priya Mohan\nI think decision enhancement is there. I said, again, this is very personal. I can't talk for GC at all because look, it's each of us use it differently.\ndon't think as investors, you get mandates to do anything. That's why the team is working on some horizontal tools.\n\n@26:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nto help yeah for me it helps in thought you know in data and diligence depending on how high quality your prompts are and the research results which are probably not always very reliable right when it might just we call it hallucination it might just hallucinate and give you this this company is great at this and it might not wait my hand or just be justified at all how do you handle I mean or have you faced those things right now so far with your research that you have utilized or you always do some kind of like when we we don't write the whole member there's always a human person who's just looking at it and we have to ultimately present to the board so we cut cut out lot of that so initial results I mean is it really you would say that okay it helps me 50 percent to my research I can rely on 50 percent or it's it's very hard to give you no it doesn't I mean like it's part of the process I don't think I'm able to assign like it helps me 50\n\n@27:00 - Priya Mohan\nI mean it really has expanded the productivity, think like two of us can work in a deal of putting like some four people with the amount of thing you can do, but I can't say like it helps me 50%, 60% because like I said our business is so unique, it's very hard to kind of calibrate that.\n\n@27:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely. this is exactly the kind of feedback that I've been getting with a lot of other interviews as well.\nwhen we start, when this I said when I started the interview that when we start, there are you today, which are doable, which are great, but on the ground tangibly, the kind of benefits that we are leaping right now, I mean, of course, in the future, they will be better and we are building tools and to help us out, but as of yet right now, the kind of benefits from generative AI is limited in a lot of the course, you feel the same?\n\n@28:04 - Priya Mohan\nI don't think it's lifted. I think it's more the education and the pervasiveness of how it trickles down and actually getting the right talent to abstract it out for usage.\nI think this is the cusp. I do believe it's going to change. I think with people running things on their local machines and everything, the education is expanding and everything.\nRight now, probably it's in Bangalore, Silicon Valley and Delhi. It's not like ripple effect everywhere. But I think in all big age technologies, I think you will go through this sudden culmination point.\nSo I don't think it is my answer will be nuanced. I said no, it's not applicable.\n\n@28:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthink it's going through the question is currently, are we able to reap the benefits? In future, yes, we are planning.\nWe have things in the pipeline that we are building on things and it will work and it give us benefits.\nBut currently, right now, as in,\n\n@29:02 - Priya Mohan\nI think that's what I'm saying. don't think I want to say a yes or no, because like in the process of transformation, I think it's in the stage of evolution where in like with most tech products, it's it's unfair to say we're not ripping it now because it's going through that transformation, right?\nLike to me is that trajectory promising? That's what will make me answer. Right? So I'm not able to honestly give you, you know, it is not relevant now because you have to go through like if you take any of the steam engine or anything it went through that culmination before it becomes widespread adopted.\nSo I'm not able to personally say yes or no now.\n\n@29:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. So let us say in terms of strategic goals, right?\n\n@29:46 - Priya Mohan\nI have like another minute.\n\n@29:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have to rush. had a four o'clock I pushed but okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I thought I scheduled a five minute, but that's fine.\nThat's absolutely fine. think I've got most of the things which are out here. One one final this is your opinion and this would not probably be GC opinion in terms of your opinion what you feel that right now in terms of the way that generative AI is coming in right and from whatever you have seen so far personally would you say that in terms of our operations right and again this is not in terms of in generic health or research or other thing but in terms of operations would it be able to make things faster and if yes in your opinion again which is subjector how far a horizon you see that it would be probably effective in I think it is definitely look it's also problem statements productivity is clear but it's nuanced I think people have not been able to separate the economic impact with just the productivity for example I have a very strong view on pool AI replace I don't think for example people talk about blue color I don't think in India the labor arbitrage is so\n\n@31:00 - Priya Mohan\nI like as long as there's more and more people coming from informal economies to formal economies and actually joining factories now these factories to actually spend the money to put large focus software and edge devices while replacing hundreds of people probably who will get at the same cost with very reliable skills.\nI think the coding population, white collared, the low and white collared will get completely replaced and that will be.\nSo basically I genuinely believe today like you can build a 10 billion dollar company closer to a Google which just like say 50 people versus like 5000 people.\nSo that's at one extreme but at the local traditional industry I think for me people have to really understand the impact of AGI with the economic impact and the economics has some, it's a complex adaptive system.\nThere's a cultural issue, there's a geographical issue, there's a political issue and there is a labor arbitrage. You have to consider all four to see is this gender\nI think ROI will people even adopt you can't just take the technology saying of course the technology does what it does But what are the incentives and disincentives for it to do so my view is I think It will make a lot more impact in certain industries and maybe lot lesser in some other industries I don't really agree.\n\n@32:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean what I have seen is there's a problem where people are looking at AI as a key and they're searching for a lock In reality, it should be they have a problem that they want to unlock using the AI key, right?\nIt's just moving up a little bit way these days.

I did.\n\n@0:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. understand. How have you been? It's up to you. Okay.\n\n@0:20 - Heena Bose\nHow is everything? family and everything.\n\n@0:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@0:26 - Heena Bose\nEverybody's fine.\n\n@0:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMichigan is fine. fine.\n\n@0:32 - Heena Bose\nVery nice. it's so good to see you after such a long time. But it's always good to see you.\nI don't understand.\n\n@0:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ndon't understand.\n\n@0:42 - Heena Bose\ndon't understand. understand. Yeah, you're not here. I think it's very affectionate. For me, I don't judge people by parents.\nyou know, genuine authenticity. It's been always like you, I'm with you always.\n\n@1:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou're sick and you can wear a wig. Exactly.\n\n@1:08 - Heena Bose\nplease give my love to Prachi as well and tell me, well, how can I help you?\n\n@1:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I'll give you that. So I think the link is happening. wanted to do a research, right? Okay. The research was on the court.\nHow are actually companies using Gen AI today, right?\n\n@1:32 - Heena Bose\nA boss has a hit, say, Mrs.\n\n@1:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHank, if they're like, we're trying it, but it didn't work out well, we dropped it out, right? Somewhere we feel, but it's not doing that well, and all that jazz, right?\nLook at questions around that and trying to understand how you're doing that for your organization.\n\n@1:51 - Heena Bose\nOkay.\n\n@1:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's absolutely fine for it to be honest. Right. So, I mean, I'm okay. It's okay because it.\n\n@2:00 - Heena Bose\nI mean we are the right organization because we have an in-house technology and we are basically in a scope of insurance broking.\nSo we do all insurance and we are also an in-house tech company. So we are an inshore tech organization.\nSo it is very relevant for us. Awesome, awesome.\n\n@2:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what I do is I will start taking my notes and putting the questions forward. Give me one quick second.\nAwesome. So I have it here. This is being recorded so I will not have to take notes per se but I will just go across.\njust to put a baseline to this, right, what is the industry and sector that we are catering? Yeah. So we are into insurance.\n\n@3:03 - Heena Bose\nSo we are an insurance broker. So if you ask me any type of insurance, whether it is medical, whether it is term, whether it is non-medical, direct as you know.\nSo we do everything under this umbrella. So yeah, so we have majorly three segments, we call it corporate individual and we call it general lines.\n\n@3:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIndividual definitely has an individual.\n\n@3:30 - Heena Bose\nI mean, you go and look for insurance for your needs, for your family. That is that segment. And corporate is, for if you're working in a school or a college and how make it into teachers, professors, their insurance as an organization.\nAnd as an organization, I mean, how it helps them to keep the employees engaged and know, higher, better talent.\nSo we cater to, I mean, thousand plus clients in Singapore. and we have close to 10,000 plus corporates all across.\nI'll start with just mentioning that this company is privately owned. We don't have any investors and to start by a British gentleman named Neil Raymond.\nSo he's from an engineering mindset and he went literally 25 years because 2025 is going to be the 25th year for the organization in Hong Kong and he went there and he wanted to take motor insurance and from that perspective he thought that the market is in 2000 at that time very manual and you have to go as an individual person figure out and calculate everything yourself.\nSo he made a system. mean he did testing with his friends and it worked out and that's the foundation of the business we started with and now one out of three cars in Hong Kong is insured by Pacific Prime.\nSo then we expanded to different countries, different segment of insurance and now we are in 14 countries and with 1000 employees.\n\n@5:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAwesome, that's a very good use case because this is not scalable without going towards AI and without going towards automation and stuff.\n\n@5:27 - Heena Bose\nAll and similar to my journey as well, we keep because when I joined in Singapore, if you asked me in 2012, we went fantastic and this is how I expressed my career in Singapore.\nWe were in one of the fantastic offices which would have amazing layers and they can scan your face at that point and let you in but then when you go to people desk, it's paper.\nI mean they're working\n\n@6:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\non paper, the manual thing.\n\n@6:02 - Heena Bose\nThen my journey started, why we have from the back, and why we have all these claims manually assessed. And it's also people who do it better, and there's talent for it, but you have to evolve.\nSo from 2015 onwards, we started going into this journey of technology. And I will just give you an average size, an average claim from a person who will, you know, there's a person who has filed a claim.\nAnd if we have to adjudicate the claim for our clients, it will take, for example, a maternity claim, it will be a 40 pages claim, it will take minimum 40 minutes, 35 to 40, depending on the scenario, what is the maternity's normal cesarean, then you will see about whether, you know, the diapers would be paid, it will be added in the bill and etc.\nAnd these can be exclusions. It will take 35 to 40 minutes. Now with AI, and with the OCR technology with the intervention of\nautomation. A, we have paperless. B, we adjudicate the same claim which was taking like 40, 45 minutes. Now we can do within five minutes.\nHuman has to make a decision. The exclusions can be picked up through OCR, IDP, image, where you can identify the image, etc.\nAnd same work can be done. So it helps us to get efficiency and the overall turnaround time has improved from like 40, 45 days to now we can do it in one day.\nSo you know, see there, so we changed Singapore market and we were the primary Singapore market as well to changing the entire industry.\nwe went to insurers, we worked out, hey, I mean, because this was something we could do on a segment with clients, gave their self-funded claims to us, but then we went to different insurers.\n\n@9:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow does gen AI particularly if we focus on one department at a time help them so in terms of let's say let's let's start with probably sales or marketing which will be probably one of prime push areas right so how does marketing benefit out of gen AI today and what are the good stories in terms of what we have gained what we have missed right and when we fall hey this doesn't fit the bill that well right it's great it's growing but still not there see from our perspective it is very important from sales to where you can only make sales when you are very sensitive on timelines for example a client reaches out to you how fast you can give a comparison what's existing in the market if I mean me if I for example go and I mean I does reach out to our team if they can't go and give the client within 30 minutes they answer oh\n\n@10:00 - Heena Bose\nWhat type of comparison the product comes in, what type of medical insurance comes in, and because they will just give you a head count and they will give you a brief that, you know, this is the basic government requirements which we have to cover, give me the cheapest two highest and what is the coverage in scope.\nSo for us it has helped because as soon we can input the information, the output can be because we build a system internally that we will already have comparison quotes from different intros in our system, they have to put the inputs and it will give them a comparison and we can immediately send it at night, because then what helps the client can make decision making and the sales can be closed faster, the lesser the time is there in a response time from the time we receive the query to the time we can give the solution, the more closer you are to there to close the sales.\nSo therefore it is very very important for us to give them tools. Human element is there by giving experience, giving consulting, which will better, which inshora will work better.\nSo that's a hit, that's definitely a hit. can generative AI still go and do the decision making, final decision making, not yet?\nBecause we still need a human to approach who gives them a comparison like on employee experience, overall technology experience, where the human can add the consulting approach that has not been yet automated.\nWe are working on it. So I would not say it's a hit, it's still a miss, but it's a journey, for me, it's still a step ahead to the journey will get better every year.\nSo you make it from that perspective.\n\n@11:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo two things that I heard, one was the final decision. We did not want to still leave it on the AI segment of things.\n\n@11:59 - Heena Bose\nThe second thing that I\n\n@12:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI understood it was that the personal interaction is also got something that we really want to leave out to AI because many a times I mean you might want the human touch to that interaction as well, is that correct?\nYes.\n\n@12:17 - Heena Bose\nOkay.\n\n@12:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. And what about the other department? like marketing, how does marketing utilize AI and how does it move ahead with that?\n\n@12:25 - Heena Bose\nTo back in the island and who helps us to go and doing... You do not have...\n\n@12:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyou can do marketing to a level of intermediate tree level that...\n\n@12:46 - Heena Bose\nIt comes to a comparison sort. That's still on human, but...\n\n@12:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBecause it will take your case study.\n\n@13:00 - Heena Bose\nIt can be, you know, sent to one go in the form of videos, but the final check still is done by human.\n\n@13:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI know, yeah, you totally broke up for me, I couldn't hear any part of this segment.\n\n@13:22 - Heena Bose\nHello?\n\n@13:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, still frozen.\n\n@14:01 - Heena Bose\nYeah, now it's better, I've rejoined it, starting from where I left, from marketing we have actually reduced our marketing team, it was a big team earlier, so now you still need for final the final check of the human, the output is not, you're still geni, AI will make mistakes and you have to make it humanized and numbers and it's, you know, foundational to be real for you, but of course we have reduced our, from, it has helped marketing team to come up with foundational structure and, you know, making sure the grammatical mistakes are not there, from that it is better.\n\n@14:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, from what I understand is, it is being used as a tool to reduce. time and improve efficiency but it cannot like keep the decision and go ahead and do a marketing campaign right now for us.\n\n@15:09 - Heena Bose\nIt can do marketing campaign but you do need a human to do a final check you know whether everything is right you cannot because still you cannot rely 100 percent it's there 80-85 percent 15 percent your human has to go and verify the data and imports before it goes to your end client.\n\n@15:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's that's standard with the rest of the industry as well they are also doing the same but for support especially for L1 L2 they are planning to do clean outsource are we also doing something similarly.\n\n@15:42 - Heena Bose\nNow we have we we are organization who believes in keeping control of things so we don't do outsourcing we have a team in outsourcing sorry outsourcing in terms of outsourcing to gen AI and AI for\nYeah, L1, L2 is definitely Jenny and then there is somebody to proof checking and making sure it is relevant to the messaging what you want to do.\n\n@16:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so L1, L2 are we leaving it to AI to handle or are we still having a human in the loop?\n\n@16:20 - Heena Bose\nWe still need human in loop, we are still not there but of course we don't need too much of human efforts, if there is a team of six you might need only one loop.\nOkay, six to one loop because ultimately it's a journey right, human will tell you what needs to be improved next timeline, pipeline from that perspective also you need to have a human.\n\n@16:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, so other than this in terms of other departments like tech or whatever other departments you guys have like I'm not sure what other departments mainly have a lot of admin.\nWe have a 24-7 health desk.\n\n@17:04 - Heena Bose\nWe have a backend team. Other than that, let's talk with we have a health desk like which has five languages and runs 24-7.\nAnd I mean definitely self-help, mean AI, gen AI technology is helping because you can come up with app boards and the information can be found and because earlier the information is segregated.\nNow what it does, that once a query is put down by a user, it can help to consolidate and respond.\nAnd we are trying to maneuver and make it better year by year. Of course, sometimes if after two, I mean, self-help checks if the employee doesn't find the information that is routed to a human.\nBut the first layer of checking is the technology through self-help.\n\n@18:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd how many, I mean, what ratio do you feel that, I mean, 80% of the time people can just bounce off the self-help and 20% of the time they need to get to a human, or let's say...\nNo, I understand.\n\n@18:13 - Heena Bose\nis a little different, because when people go to a hospital, they call you, right? And it depends on the sensitivities.\nLike, if you're in a hospital still for forms, you can go and take it as a self-help. But you need a human to manage the emergency, because at that time, the human is not working.\nSo they just want what are my plans, so how can I do et cetera, the basic information? For that bit, from claiming any sensitive emergencies, you need to be air-lifted, if you're in different country, and some accident has happened, you still need human.\nBut for those emergencies, you need human, for hospital dealing, you need human. But, for example, my independent details, or I haven't received the payment, or...\nmission needs to be amended that you can do through self-help which is but a equilibrium for us 70% there's always claims and and from that you know you can automate slow by I mean step-by-step 20% has been automated but still human calls you.\n\n@19:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay and in terms of let us say HR or admin how are you benefiting?\n\n@19:28 - Heena Bose\nYeah so because that means the work we try to work in extended harm for our clients so the work which they were unable to do they need to outsource as an HR partners and they don't want to do so our admin has been able to take over that work earlier we had so much of manual work for ourselves that we could not help our HR because we were solving the issues at our side because it's manual but we've automated everything.\nNow what we do is that we still human and then go administrative to take over kinds, I mean work in that space so that they don't need to hire or spend too much money on that and then we have them to save cost.\n\n@20:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, okay and in terms of HR, I'm using tools to help internal teams and all how are we doing that?\n\n@20:23 - Heena Bose\nI think we have an in-house system which is actually from the time the sales is done and mean and on-boarding of sensors until the bills I mean we have a system it is tied up to the finance.\nNow HR system job is to go and hire people, to see about the people who's relevant with the experience so AI can help in there but the point is whenever we receive resume somebody has to receive so we need a personal I mean person to be there because it can only categorize\nand departments to which the resume can go to but still whenever it comes to reading the resumes and it's I mean there's an individual person sitting in and setting the interviews and but when you want board them again it is automated so whenever there's an element where you are talking to people there's a human involved or but once you're onboarded them then their checks their background checks and everything are automated because you will set put information in the system even with the send to user they will fill the service home it will be consolidated the raw data can be analyzed by HR and then it can go through that system will help okay okay and in terms of the departments where probably you have not been able to use genii at all\n\n@22:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHas there been any such instances or departments or problems that you are facing?\n\n@22:05 - Heena Bose\nYeah, like for example, we have a team name, account management, they see sales that have their job and they give it to account management to handle them, client regularly.\nSo there are some, these are managing the revenue, once the sales have been done. these are always done with the human because ultimately you need to understand what's going with the client, how we can help the client need, what do they need to, I mean, what we have promised them, we deliver them.\nSo there is always human to tell them and then what are their problems to understand their problems and help them to give automated solutions also account management.\nSo ongoing servicing team for account manager, like for example, you have open an account, there is a account manager allocated to you, right, who will help you.\nwho on daily needs or yearly needs and they are not in a banking scenario, you only need them one, two, time, whenever you have a problem because everything is there.\nIn insurance scenario, you will need the account management team to be there regularly because somebody will meet with an accident, somebody will have a cancer, will hospitalize, managing the software edge for the employees, therefore the account manager is necessary.\nSo that bit, we don't need to automate as well.\n\n@23:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I see two aspects to this. One aspect, I see that high business value, the other aspect I see is since this is a human interaction business where human interaction is really critical in terms of how you change.\nclient and the client comes back to you because this is recurring business mostly. So, those are the areas where you really want to push and have humans instead of AI, all the supported by AI, but direct infraction should be human.\nCorrect.\n\n@24:14 - Heena Bose\nAnd it also directly is proportional to retention of clients, right? Because we have annual renewals. So, I mean, you're not there at the time.\nSo, next year they will not appoint you. So, we have to make sure that directly proportional to the experience given to the client.\nBy the way, we have clients which are like 22, 23 years in the relationship with our organization. So, again, that makes us go and believe in the theory that wherever the human interaction is important in retaining the client, it is you don't AI on RST.\nRIT is a request for proposal or tender making process where the client will go here and throw out a tender in the market like and ask different bidders to come in and different brokers will come in with their things.\nSo we are trying to say you know these are standard processes if you can automate and I mean you can spend less time because we know exactly what is our standard operating processes and we can answer that based on the questions.\nSo we are trying to see if we can use gen AI there to spend less time in those activities but more be there in now if you have to present a tender then a human is needed right.\nAnd AI cannot one present the tender because the class of whatever 300 pages you have submitted it needs to be concise in 20 minutes PowerPoint presentation then a human can go and give you the concise motion.\n\n@26:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd one of the core reasons I believe for that is that the background knowledge is not something that you can all feed into the air.\nYou have the background reference of where exactly you want to be and where you want to to the picture.\n\n@26:14 - Heena Bose\nAnd also one more thing, Vicki, trust cannot be made by the knowledge which is there. The trust can be only made appointing with the human interaction and the experience as you write.\n\n@26:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you, not the EQ, right? Yes, yes, yes. So moving on towards the EQ side of things, mean, so this is more of work that we do and how we integrate.\nBut internally, and this is like totally internally within the team are people, are employees. How do we use Genii to them internally?\nAnd this is not about for the operations, mean, it might be for how the higher it might be for how we give them support in terms of your own leaves or your own let's say performance right or in whichever way how do we use so one part of it is how do we have Jenny I work with our people internally for our organization internally not external this time we're looking inside and the second thing is that for how do we portray this in the culture to what people do we say hey you should use Jenny I where required or do we say hey it is mandatory to go ahead and use Jenny I have certain things right how do we how do we merge so one part of the question is how does Jenny I internally help things right second how do we help teams to actually accept an AI or build up on Jenny I or push them towards Jenny I so that it can be used more and more and we can\nand actually have better things coming in. Or maybe innovation coming in from the employees side in these times.\n\n@28:07 - Heena Bose\nI give one example and I'm very passionate about this one. After course COVID, and I'll talk more to Asia perspective, not going to talk on European American perspective, okay?\nAnd I'm going to take a topic of mental wellness from individual employee perspective. When you have to work from home and from specifically why I'm mentioning Asia because it's a taboo way.\nYou cannot go and talk about your mental wellness issues and to individuals. So we work on technology where we let them journalize, where we let them go.\nJenny, I use as a punching back box, you know, where they can journalize, they can write out how are you feeling today.\nAnd it's a personal space to them, right? But when they say, how are you feeling and this is not good, then they will give you option, they will give you reasoning and you will journalize.\nBut if it is like three, four days and they have been feeling low, then it will give them an option.\nyou want to reach out to a counselor and then it will give them, if they say yes and I have 26 nationalities in the office, right?\nSo then if that they say yes, then it can be in which language and which consultant do you want to reach?\nIs it nutrition? Because you don't know which level of problems you are in unless nobody can figure it out.\nSo they can click and anonymously they can go and have a meeting with the counselor and then if the counselor is dean, if it needs to be something medically necessary, they will refer to a doctor and then their individual journey will start.\nAnd this mental wellness thing is a way evident for people in Europe and North America to take it as a right and they will be open about it.\nIn Asia context, it is still a taboo that if you tell your colleague or if your partner has come to know, they will think that you are not deemed to fit for the job.\nAnd it's a very sensitive topic. So from that perspective, we have been able to use for the wellness in AI, you know, journaling and then it goes to, know, I mean, if you're consultant for co-chained, et cetera, before it goes to a psychiatrist or psychologist, because it can be different levels.\nSo you let the employee make a decision from that health. So I personally feel it's a good change for Asian market and they can learn to see which stays they are in.\nBut sometimes even people don't. No, they have a problem. That's the reason we train our managers because they are with their employees practically until then hours a day and pick up some signs and help them to go that route, still for that you need a human.\nSo, you know, what I'm trying to tell you is that individuals who are well aware and conscious, they would make the effort to use genii and try to do journaling.\nBut people who do not know they have an issue that still need like people who are around you and managers and they've been trained, you know, particular way to identify it as an ongoing problem and some help is needed.\nSo, that let me try to work out, still I don't have any compulsive study. But all we are saying that we are trying to use genii that we can remove the taboo and we can utilize self-help for themselves in journalising things and journal\nYeah, the reason I will be being so much is because that is so much now, so that's an easy.\nI mean, yes, I don't have to study, I mean, if you ask me is there an ROI, is there a return on the investments, but we are working with partners and maybe in coming years we can give you more best studies on it.\n\n@32:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI could probably ask the professor and see if there are studies on this and refer you to some papers which might really back up on this.\n\n@32:40 - Heena Bose\nYeah, great, yeah, and we are working with different partners in Singapore, and but and the companies are also opening up after COVID to hear this and they want to make investment, but because every investment needs to come with ROI, so it's a structure we are figuring out right now in our journey.\nthat's right yeah and that stuff that's not easy it is I mean hard to balance it both ways it's really hard yep that that gives me some some amount of insight and I mean how do you how do you push in terms of them now picking up and trying to innovate and get more on the table so yeah if you ask me you know it's only and only through communication and I need to also tell you what lesson I've learned is what empty number of scenarios you do communication which is never enough so a human communication through visual communication is also very important where you you know in factories we have run down some creative videos for them because they sit in pantry while eating lunch and he can be aware then posters as a communication then human communication\nWe do regular meetings, but the point is you have to make a culture with constant effort to drive this every day, it's a part of journey.\nBut you feel that we are good enough, they can be now communication, we have a company internet, we try to do communication there as well, but we find new sources, wherever I can get their one minute span of attention, we find new innovative ways to do better communication.\n\n@34:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat's the communication? What is it that we are trying to communicate? mean, are we trying to push them to work?\n\n@34:41 - Heena Bose\nYeah, the benefits, how we also from case studies where JNI has helped in certain processes and which has helped them better, but whenever there is an automation there is always something you need to also understand that they will be drawbacks and it comes in.\nphases, right?\n\n@35:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou cannot have a perfect solution in one go.\n\n@35:03 - Heena Bose\nSo making them ready to accept something with some flaws and over a period of you know with their feedbacks it will improve because as culturally making people to understand that you can never have a perfect solution in one go.\nIt will come in stages and always give you and we do case studies, we make them guinea and once we go live as well the feedbacks still keeps on coming but they're part of the journey and that's the reason we keep on inventing, innovating when they see their feedback has been taken and put down in automation and you know the credit is given to them they really feel aligned with you in this journey to automate and of course adding value to them making changes as an organization we have a culture.\nWe don't hire leadership from outside. We grew leaders internally, so therefore it motivates them also to grow up in their career and move in different countries.\n\n@36:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut I would also require trading them out, because most of them might not be trading in Jennyai or usage of Jennyai or how they can basically produce in China.\n\n@36:20 - Heena Bose\nYeah, that's a part of definitely this organization as an organization, they're very big on people training and that's the reason we don't outsource things, because when we do ourselves we have so much of learning so that we can give training through communication and we train and train and this is our groundwork to make sure that it's training done in pieces of videos, communication and communication and sessions, but it's never enough.\nJust for the hearing.\n\n@36:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow do you measure your success in terms of, hey, I train so much? I gave so much messaging etc and has it been beneficial or not.\ncoming back to our way, mean business sides of that, right? I mean, I've already seen that we have given and what we got back and the communication we have done and what we got back, how do you measure that or what is your, what the head is right on that?\n\n@37:19 - Heena Bose\nSo, I've seen in past three years, but once, first year I couldn't even track it. I need to tell you, first year, it was my own revelation, I thought it is done enough and I do what we need to do.\nThen I came into a thought process, no, it's a continuous journey, I have to take it, but we have to measure it.\nSo ultimately, we started measuring whatever training we are doing, we do assessments and we do quarterly quizzes because it makes people win the prizes in a nice way.\nThen I've tied them into their goals a little bit that they have to score X percentage. But what I've seen is then on, I mean, that it has helped me to improve my cross-selling.\nBecause with constant new ideas, choices, M&C started getting tied up to like five percent of innovative quotient to your goals in the company, it also helps you to reduce, increase your cost sales.\nSo this year I could see that, you know, one department selling the other department things because we have different departments, right, and group into individual general lines, it it went up with ten percent this year.\nSo I can see the benefits in terms of it, it does come to you in numbers and it helps you internally, people becomes your sales people to go and talk to clients and different things because they have knowledge, they have awareness for the company.\nAnd I've also seen that I'm not using talent to competitors because they start believing within the product, so much that they think in the market.\n\n@39:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nis a better product than the competitor.\n\n@39:01 - Heena Bose\nSo why should we go and jump jobs?\n\n@39:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right. That's right. And in terms of these, how do you, how do you numerically calculate between, this is a training amount that I spent and this is a number of trainings that I've done and this is a tangible output that has come through.\n\n@39:22 - Heena Bose\nOkay, so you see the number of, I mean, quizzes you do, and initial training you do, there's a five-day training which we do for every new hire.\nThen there's a quarterly training for one, two days, and then there's a constant quarterly communication. You can calculate and then what is retention rate of crimes, what is your cross selling and what is your retention rate of employees, these are all correlations which works.\n\n@39:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, but you know, how do we fit that, that is in that day. Jenny, you cannot do No, but Jenny, you cannot still, I cannot do\n\n@41:00 - Heena Bose\nknow the product better. We have made the product better and you know team but I cannot say this totally Jenni.\nIt is a component with that to be mixed match with experience, culture, people, then Jenni and knowledge in the end of it.\nYeah but you have definitely seen one thing that yeah it has helped you reduce the number of people who can do the same job at the same of course.\nI will give you my claims journey where I can give you actual numbers where we were with the team of we were doing I think five million claims and if I take and take a team it will become a 40 member team.\noperate with 10 members right now. So it has definitely given me reduction of general admin and claims job.\n\n@41:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat makes sense. Now, more angle to this, that's very dangerous and that really is a matter of lot of discussion this, losing proprietary information while being able to do JNI, because end of that, you are not running the models, the models are all outside, and you have no control over their most of them.\nHow do you, how do you as a policy or as a principal manage that part of it? Because you have, you would have a lot of proprietary data, you are doing business in a competitive scheme where almost everybody is nearly in the same bucket, right?\nA bit good on certain aspects, a bit different on certain aspects, but nearly in the same cohort. So, how do you change, how do you protect that proprietary information and how do you balance that value?\n\n@42:55 - Heena Bose\nSo, we work with, that's the reason, I mean, it is very, very important. for us to work with people who are on site and you know that's a reason our technology IIT people we don't go and give it to a third party vendor but now you're working with JNI that's the reason then the IIT makes a decision with what needs to be at our site and what information can only go to JNI to make some decision making sensitive information and information which will help them to identify a person we actually try to hide it and then utilize and then come up with the structure internally that it is only where they have to make a decision unknowingly and we mask the data and then it is turned into our on site calculations where people can edit changes so that type of we're done but honestly we are very very mindful of using open AI resources and because we have a very\nsensitive information related to claims, and therefore...\n\n@44:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, it's one part, you know, VII is totally one part, but more than that, there will be organizational internals, right, that you don't want to share out, probably the way that you calculate, the way that you are asserting, the way that you are checking your risk management, right, the way that you are doing fraud management.\n\n@44:21 - Heena Bose\nreason it is, you know, and that's the reason we don't go and give work to third party. I mean, we try to build ourselves, we have a developer, engineering people, everything in-house, and that's the reason we don't go out and work, but if we are using Genii and Open, AI resources, we have worked it out in such a way that it is least information utilized in so that it's not out there, because, and somewhere we, what I've heard of,\nit can be put at the site, you can buy and you can take that information to a such way that it is put on one side, you don't need to disclose it.\nThey are going to go with good names of brands, but I know Azur, right now my team work, we don't work with AWS, we work on Azur and then they have So are you all using company in the backend?\n\n@45:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's like, is the middle person and opening eyes? Yeah, I know that. are multiple layers to that as well.\n\n@45:40 - Heena Bose\nI know, and that's the reason to be very mindful and making sure that, I mean, whatever information we are giving, but what I understand and Vicki have to correct me because my understanding is that my technology had told me that whatever we are using, we try to utilize\non site and keep it at hours servers here so that it is not going but I can still check but we are very mindful of giving information and using open AI resources but they try to build internally that's my understanding.\n\n@46:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe core reason is that most of these large LLMs right the ones that you will charge everybody and others.\nThey need a lot of resources to run and for a single organization the consumption is not justifying the expense because of which we use open AI we use let's say Claude we use Microsoft backup we use Google I mean all these companies which are actually providing these last three models because for them the economies of scale work for us it won't.\nAnd when we are sending to them there are possibilities and again there are I mean debatable questions around here.\nhave signed a let's say a letter of intended here. mean, I'm not going to carry your data over or I'm not going to utilize your data, but it's there is always things that have happened in the past that we are all aware of.\nAnd a lot of these people use the book that is being done to retrain their own model, right? So you are asking who is Hina?\nmean, the model says I don't know and you say, hey, here's an document read this and tell me who is Hina.\nAnd the next time the model comes out, it automatically goes, we see that's not magical. It has taken the data and trained itself, right?\nYeah, yeah.\n\n@47:37 - Heena Bose\nSo we don't use JAD GPT, okay? And we don't we, I mean, because such model, we try to make bots internally and we try, it's our proprietary rights and we try to, because we have developers, engineers and everything.\nSo we feed and it is ongoing cycle. keep on feeding on it so that we have control, but like, like now,\nAnd, I mean, we were working with AWS. Now, we're very mindful whenever we use their products, we are trying to make sure that the PI information, but of course, the structurally, how you're working on that, that disclosure is there.\nBut as far in our business, we are not given all the secrets and of like where you can identify the person's sensitive data and all, I mean, we take control of that layer.\nBut I will check with my technical team as well that from the vendors, Azure perspective, any technically we are using in the open AI resources or not.\n\n@48:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd that's reason why it's like this Microsoft is in between, open AI is providing a model to Azure and Azure is utilizing those models in the back end.\nthat's how it generally is working today, right? And there are ways, so even you're talking about internal chat. to internal chatbots also would go to and then go open AI and then back.\nThat's a journey it takes, right?\n\n@49:07 - Heena Bose\nOkay, I'm not very sure I have to check on that one because my understanding is that as far you keep it on premise and you keep things under your control and everything.\nI mean, this is our property, right? It cannot be accessed by anyone. But let me On-prem is expensive, know.\n\n@49:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nrunning on-prem is expensive, very expensive.\n\n@49:27 - Heena Bose\nYeah, that's the reason we have a very expensive company because we have on-premise things because of the sensitivity of the data and also we are liable by the countries where we are in.\nLike, for example, in Singapore, we have to retain data. cannot give, I mean, you have EU gold standards to match, Singapore gold standards to match.\nSo that's why I think it goes, lot of our thing goes into managing that bit.\n\n@49:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's a foundational cost for us.\n\n@50:00 - Heena Bose\nbut and also because we work with banks and everything. So it's unnecessary thing and we get audited.\n\n@50:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe just agree.\n\n@50:11 - Heena Bose\nWe have lots of business where we work with banks and financial institutes and we have to make sure that on premise it is there.\nBut I can check that You have a lot of laws. GDPR probably might not apply to you but HIPAA laws and PII laws and all those very clearly.\nWe have PTA which applies to single HIPAA in replies to us but we have VNUS and VNUK as well so GDPR applies there.\n\n@50:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay great. So on the hindsight like what do you think we could have done better with JNI? Hey this is one avenue that we probably could have explored more or this is something that we should not have done.\n\n@50:54 - Heena Bose\nI think I keep on telling my technical team right now is that it is too much of a hype.\nplace human age, it will not. So let's understand maybe down 20, 30 years, I do know but definitely I can tell you next five years it is not because it is not that yet mature market.\nWe will make some decisions and it might help us in aiding and reducing the turnaround time accuracy but we are not there that I can completely take away human out from this system.\nSo that's something I think we need to understand and we are working on that journey. So if you ask me it can help you to reduce what was done maybe in one hour to maybe 10 seconds but still a human is needed.\nSo I will not leave the full decision making to JNI.\n\n@51:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI will let them to aid you in decision making.\n\n@51:57 - Heena Bose\nwe are that part of yeah we'll be in a part of journey right now and rest we are exploring it's still a fancy word to me because I haven't seen my investments in terms of yeah reducing head down but what it will lead to future I mean I'm think 2526 is going to be a very very important year for us where we can see the definition how it turns or because see we have been playing around this year we have been playing around how to make better decision-making better new look and feel but whether it will be trending the market in 2526 I'm not sure yet so if you ask me more fancy word to me than a daily use word right now it's I haven't been able to get the fancy word that means I know it is a must it will be there but I am not able to get conclusive study that it will take over decision-making\n\n@53:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI totally agree. Now, this fancy word so far, conclusively, what do you feel that it has really given you in terms of, hey, these are the things that definitely does well and from my experience I've seen it, these are the things that does well.\n\n@53:20 - Heena Bose\nDefinitely, it helps you in aiding you to make better written proposals, better communications styles to talk to clients, better, it brings brevity, which you would have explained in few things.\nI mean, it can come and do it in one sentence for you. Will it actually does the work? I'm not sure.\nYou still need a human mind to think, but it definitely reduces the turnaround time and quality. Right.\n\n@53:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd where do you think it really miserably failed altogether?\n\n@54:00 - Heena Bose\nAnd wherever you are talking to human, for example, if handling, my team is handling a call for a person in hospital and it will give, and if at that time somebody is admitted to hospital and the person is trying to figure out that they are not letting me admit or it will be cashless, I need to pay money or not, it will give answers which are vague, there it will not work because it will just irritate the person who is calling, they need immediate decision making, yes or no, don't need, yes, no maybe and there it will not work because you need some comforting, you need that we are there, go ahead, so that type of a thing it will not yet work but if I have a password issue and I'm calling and it doesn't impact my mood and the intent, of course it can work very well, I have more patience for you.\nAlso, when it goes to...\n\n@55:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\na level business decision where it would impact your top line or your bottom line, you would really want a human to actually look at it before it goes across.\n\n@55:09 - Heena Bose\nYeah, anything which is managing employee experience from emergency, my clients experience on retaining the client and me making a decision for career of people, aiding decision how it will help the future of the company, I will rely on a moment.\n\n@55:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat, so last two questions that I will have, one is what are the future plans where you feel, hey, in the hype that is created, I can see that Jenny, I can give me these results, but I've not seen the results yet, but I think it can help me in these aspects of what I read, what I hear, what I talk about.\n\n@55:52 - Heena Bose\nYeah, that's the reason we are working on Jenny, I am meeting lot partners, what they are doing. and I'm keen to learn, I mean how it can help, so I am on that trend but I mean for me it's still a very, very fancy word because we haven't seen this art but from testing because see we were the people who actually from paper moved to automated solutions so we want to be ahead in the journey so we are keen to know which journeys it can help, so from there I'm there, I mean from the stories do you think that that might really make a big difference to you?\nYeah from we have I mean we have certain offices where admins are doing work it will at that I think it will take away immediately those rules and we should give our people high value added and cross training so we've started working because we I foresee that certain billings, certain admins\nCertain, you know, decision-making of claims, that will be in a year's time by Chennai and we will be investing in that.\nSo what we have started doing is we have cross-training team because knowing one skill is not, I mean, will suffice right now.\nI'd be aware that we need to do a cross-scaling right now because once it takes time managing the change management.\nSo that's the step we have already started doing that, know, each team should know each team's work. We have actually like, for example, we have segregation admin claims and help desk.\nSo we are trying to train all of them in all the scenarios because whatever work, then I don't need to go and take the job out.\nBut there's a human in making decision while Chennai is doing the basic foundational work.\n\n@57:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, what I understand is you would be probably looking forward at, hey, what are the other tasks that... I can do, in a sense, where it doesn't need that human touch, where I can actually get further down in terms of lower value decisions, not the higher value decisions.\n\n@58:11 - Heena Bose\nTrue value decision and there's a human making the decision once the output is out to the user.\n\n@58:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you still want a decision to be human right now, I'm not looking at that even the lower level decisions to be taken by AI right now, is that correct?\n\n@58:31 - Heena Bose\nCorrect, because the point is, I mean, historically, because when we moved from paper to automated journey, we always had two case studies running simultaneously, right?\nOne was like, this would go, 80% will be done, I mean, we still had, they will be a trade off and had off between human technology.\nBut once you are in a journey, like six, nine months and you see that you get confident in the results are better day by day and the maneuvering is above 90% done by automation, then you will let the human be out.\nAll right.\n\n@59:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's building.\n\n@59:14 - Heena Bose\nExactly.\n\n@59:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou cannot immediately say, Oh, this is automated.\n\n@59:19 - Heena Bose\nNext day, I'm not there. so it's a we will do some cross training and we will see where the handoffs and the checks needs to be done and gradually eliminate that.\nRight.\n\n@59:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's that totally big sense and and what would be your suggestion in terms of their AI strategy for similar companies or smaller companies, right?\nWhat let's say much earlier in their journey in terms of implementing AI. What do you think your recommendation would be?\nHow should they be approaching implementation of JNI in all aspects of the company?\n\n@1:00:00 - Heena Bose\nBiggest suggestion is they are small players in the market who are keen and hungry to learn and fit into your organization.\nWhile you're going, you don't need to go necessarily with big companies. You should go with the company who has an appetite to understand your requirements and keep on learning and they maneuver this with you.\nSo definitely if you don't have resources to do in-house, don't be close to it, go out, venture out, talk with small players and they'll fit into the company culture and then maneuver from there.\nThis is necessary. It's just that what is your company culture and appetite but to go, you should go in this journey sooner or later, otherwise it will be too late.\nMaybe foundational steps because we have been there 25 years, right? So we had to do manual and we are changing with times.\nMaybe those problems, processes doesn't need to be there from manual and it can be automated from one go if you are there with a small player so you don't need to do anything in house you can go out house work with vendors which are up to your appetite so that's when you do it or you will have to do it right all right it's the yeah i believe you make a journey with a vendor if you don't want to do in house with the small vendor they will work with you in this journey till you work across the years of experience otherwise you have to go and get a big vendor it will be another amount of money you have to invest that's right and developing an in-house team is also not easy because you are still not clear on your journey you are experimenting yeah yeah correct correct and then within house team see you have to have patience because at the end of the day\nI mean, you are experimenting, they will listen to you, you have more power to change things and you might spend more effort, ultimately some will come with the outside window, they are experienced, you will get the results, but it will be a little as well, depends on the journey, mean with the window you are, but I think they are very small windows as well and right now in the market.\nWhat I have come across is some ex-Google, have started their company at a small scale and they tend to cater to your services, so that's also not bad, I am talking to lot of vendors right now.\n\n@1:02:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd what do you think is the hardest hurdle that you have faced in terms of Jai implementation? The biggest hurdle, it people hurdle, it tech hurdle, is it management hurdle, what's the biggest hurdle so far?\n\n@1:02:56 - Heena Bose\nI think getting the requirements right is the hardest. if you know what product you want, so if you leave it for IT to build, they will only build the product because they are ITB.\nBut if you don't understand your client's requirements well and you don't pencil the requirements well, the IT cannot build that product and the user will not set the product with a nail on the head.\nI think getting the requirements right or the onset before you involve your ITB. That's right. think it's the foundational thing.\nIf I just get an IT and users involve, they'll give me two sets of requirements. So, understanding and cleaning the conditional scope when you're making a movie right, you get the script right.\nOnce you've got everything will fall in place. Getting the script right is very important. So, recently I was hired.\n\n@1:04:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOne of the companies for I mean getting their AI product in line. It's a big company big name so I can't name it but they were they hired me to get their existing team in line because they have not been able to deliver an AI product that they wanted when they are like very business-wise stuck because of that.\nAnd what I understood and the first thing you would not believe that I had to do with this company which had been working for one year on that product was to get back to the drawing board and tell them do you are not clear on what to or to deliver.\nExactly so I agree with The management was a high level and the teams are going their own route and there's no bridge there's nobody to bridge it because the team is not ready to ask questions to the management the management feels here I told them to do it and it's not done and and that bridge was was I think one of the core areas I had to focus on so yeah yeah yeah so this is exactly my experience because as management in my mind I need this decision.\n\n@1:05:00 - Heena Bose\nThis is the outcome and my team will say operational team will say this, this, this, sales team will say this, this, this, this, but I will make separate because the requirements were not here.\nI think getting the script right is important. Absolutely.\n\n@1:05:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ntotally agree with you and that's where most of these implementations fail. Yeah. Great. I think I've covered all questions.\nThank you so much for this. If have some other friends, you can get into it. That be your issue.\n\n@1:05:33 - Heena Bose\nLast Cedric is a French, I think he is in Malaysia, so I'll ask him as well. He's going to win pro, it's a holiday season, but very busy with the peak.\nSo that's the reason I dare not ask him right now, but I'll ask him and definitely help you.\n\n@1:05:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhenever you... That's always lucky to talk with you. I've never felt like that I'm answering questions.\n\n@1:05:56 - Heena Bose\nIt's just more exchanging our thoughts.\n\n@1:06:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, I am I'm not that good with words. I have always appreciated your way of putting forward things the way that so I mean there is one way, which is a normal way of looking at things and then there is one way the Hina way of looking at things where you look at them with a dash of color and more beauty to it and then you can share that in the right world.\nI am generally being a techie. I've been more close in terms of interaction and in terms of putting my feelings that well, but yeah, well, this is a beautiful way I would be learning.\nThank you, Vicki. I generally feel I think you're at the right scope of work.\n\n@1:06:45 - Heena Bose\nIt will really take up, I mean, if you get the communication because that's what exactly what I've observed in my techie as well.\nThey like to be quiet because they're so focused on the outcomes and everything.\n\n@1:07:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthe concentration of work getting the delivery done on time so I think you will flourish on this scope of work and let me know if I can be of any help we are way of an organization I'm learning day by day with technical team where we want to invent and do the right things but it takes lot of my efforts so I mean I have been with technology since school you know that right so I think 27 years of working and I didn't go to college I didn't go to college till Michigan was born and I thought you did not study and you are getting a good income and you are having people who believe in you and trust you and respect you and if you didn't know why I do it so I started my education after Michigan was born right I did my graduation I didn't my MBA now I'm going to a PhD that's a plan so\n\n@1:08:01 - Heena Bose\nI'm extremely proud of you and I have by the way, I had this feeling in my life because I like after 12, I was teaching and then I went to college at the University and always that has stayed in my life that I didn't go to good college, I didn't go to good college.\nNow you aspire me to go and study more, know, this year I should go and study something which now I mean you constantly need to learn and formal education is also good, you know.\n\n@1:08:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt helps you with articulation, networking, so to be very frank, education never stops. I 100% sure that Hina will be studying right now also, looking at the latest that is happening, reading about things, reading what you're saying, always continues.\nMy trust with this, when I was the head of technology for the company like I'm now just out this day, has biggest media volume later, And again...\n\n@1:09:00 - Heena Bose\nfirst.\n\n@1:09:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI was 12 past. Wow. It's huge, right? Now, I was a CTO when I just became a graduate. Right?\nso the journey has been awesome, but in the journey, I've realized one thing that knowledge and formal education, they don't go hand in hand.\nKnowledge and formal education, they are totally separate. However, formal education gives you certain aspects that while you are learning on your own, you skip.\nRight? And that is also very important. Yeah, right. That is also very important. Yeah.\n\n@1:09:42 - Heena Bose\nI mean, you know, my husband was in directing, doing music and everything and he was doing a corporate job.\nSo, I told him, there's a difference you will learn, you will learn because you're so hard working, you will learn, but you will learn that knowledge in one year.\nyou go through a structure, you do it, not only you will get the networking right but you will also get the foundational right and for that you have to invest, of course then you go and do more things on your own, don't stop your creativity but you have to get the foundation right, you have to unlearn things you know, so that's the journey and very appreciative of you and we have to meet in person, they can't predict if I definitely I'll do Q1 or Q2, me, something, then I'll let you know and you guys are here, take it, look in plan like this key, there you come to India, my home is like 15 minutes away from the airport, just drop in, see that, pick a message and bring you there, okay, done and give my life to me, yeah, done, done, thank you so much, give my life to me, take care of yourself, bye bye, pleasure talking to you.\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.

        "content": "Transcription\nSoumya Das - IIT Interview - March 25\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 50 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:00 - Soumya Das\nSorry, I walked in and I walked in walked in. Hey, hi. So, sorry, I mean, like, that we couldn't, like, meet earlier?\nYeah, but I never. Kapil said you were not feeling well. Yeah, I think last two weeks have been really bad.\nOh, no, am feeling better now.\n\n@0:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I think it's a how do you know, How do you know Kapil? Kapil and I have worked together in a few places so that's how we became close.\nI'll give you background quickly. I spend around 27 years in technology, various roles last few years mostly senior management and mostly into research and development.\nI was trying to do a 3-PhD research just to get a hang of how well we can get things done with work, right?\nThe focus area was Genia. Genia is doing very big in circles. Everybody wants some piece of Genia and everybody wants it.\nThe point is on ground, it's not a benefit, it's a benefit, it's a It's giving us something concrete, it's not something concrete.\nSo everybody has a ready, they can have a look at it. After 200 people have shared their experience and say, this doesn't great, I can quickly gain some benefits out of this in this manner.\nSo that's the intention, writing that paper and the focus is basically people like you who have been doing a lot of stuff and understanding tangibly.\nthey are the three parts of it, right? Are they part of it? Part one where we try to put you in the right cohort based on the company's eyes and everything else.\nPart two. where we try to understand tangibly to benefit me what exactly were you able to get or not get right where do you think that it really did well for you and where do you think it I mean we did a best but it couldn't go a lot of good either ways okay and the third part is more of your opinion in which when how do you opinion in terms of I mean what could we have done better what what things where is it giving you great benefits and the likes okay so I'll put forward those questions and we can then continue on that conversation whether that sounds good yeah sure like sure what do you want to structure the discussion do you have some special questions and then we can keep our discussion around those questions as I keep asking them sure awesome so just to put put right what industry and sector would you share the experience from when you have been to a lot of things\nWhere does the main gen AI? So let me also put a context around gen AI. The circle is a bigger circle, right?\nWe have been using it for many, many years. So far what?\n\n@3:11 - Soumya Das\nSorry? I said the AI circle is a big circle.\n\n@3:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe have been using it for many, many years, right? machine learning is a smaller one inside AI, and then we have deep learning is still smaller inside ML.\nGen AI is a very small niche piece, right? And that's big area of discussion, right? So what industry and sector will you represent in this?\n\n@3:38 - Soumya Das\nSo I will talk about my current organization, right?\n\n@3:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we are a fleet management task company.\n\n@3:50 - Soumya Das\nI've been here for more than five years now, five and a half years. And we have been, like you said, I mean...\nbeen a AI company since beginning, but we have been using AI tools for the last one year or so or a little more than that.\nI think we have been one of the pioneers in this space where we use a lot of machine learning models to understand driver's behaviors and coach them and then a lot of vision AI staff to understand again their driving patterns and different scenarios right from close following understanding like in an accident whose fault it is or like understand different situations if the driver is distracted or drowsy and all those\nSo, I mean, we have been using AI for a while, and JNI, using it within the product for our customers is a work in progress, and we internally use JNI, right, now pretty decently effectively, I would say, and it's been almost like 9 to 12 months that we started using it and slowly finding it really helpful in some ways.\n\n@5:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat really sets a context in a very nice way. What would be the company's size, if you would say, in terms of number of people and revenue?\n\n@5:42 - Soumya Das\nYeah, it's, are you talking about total number of employees or like engineers that are developed? Total number of employees generally, mean, since you're talking about the organization 3000.\n\n@5:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, and what would be the revenue sales? No, so 500 million. Okay and so many point of time if you feel that hey this I don't know to share that's absolutely fine but any point time you want to say that if I'm sharing this but do not quote it that's also absolutely fine okay yeah I mean revenue annual number is better not to quote but then you possibly mostly available publicly as well I am not sure exact number is there on publicly so as long as you take nearly that's fine that's absolutely fine and at any point of time feel free to say that right now in terms of AI adoption you said that product wise we are getting there we are building stuff internally we have been using it for nine twelve months right is there anything specific and I would say you would say this is the best ROI that I have got using a genia product as of the best ROI so far and one of the things that I can see and this call is the note\n\n@7:04 - Soumya Das\nYeah, I mean that has been helpful for me like a lot of meetings I've done joint and I can quickly go through the study and if I see that anything of interest and only zoomed there, which is the like there is no for more now that okay I'm not able to join the meeting.\n\n@7:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's been helpful.\n\n@7:26 - Soumya Das\nI think JNI code completion has also been pretty good though I'm not an active coder but if I have to like quickly do something like write a complex SQL query I can quickly get help and don't need to depend on someone which has been it and these are my personal things and then if I look at my team my org I think definitely coding is\nan area like we have seen significant help and like it actually definitely increasing productivity for sure. Now to what extent we are still measuring we don't know but we see definitely a productivity boost and we have some goals we want to achieve by end of year and hopefully we will be able to do it.\n\n@8:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight so when we talk about productivity boost I mean and I that you have not taken out some specific numbers but if we do a back of the envelope calculation what do you feel I mean is it a next better thing 2x1x and in terms of ROI?\n\n@8:49 - Soumya Das\nYes so ROI is I think it's true only to talk about ROI the reason being right now we\n\n@9:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ntrying out different tools and we are overpaying because we don't know what exactly it is we are experimenting so I think ROI is too early to comment on and I think in terms of productivity boost I can see I can see it's substantial and it also will improve over time as we master the tool all the tools right like I understand where to use how to use how to prompt right that's a continuous learning process right let's first look at coding per se coding may what is the biggest move for the return on investment that you are seeing right now I mean and again I understand you're not got specific numbers but in your in what you see as a back of the what do you see I mean people are able to move faster less errors let's say lesser experience required to do stuff what is your general understanding\n\n@10:00 - Soumya Das\nNo, I think it's so lesser errors. mean, I think the errors, the potential of errors can be higher unless you are double checking things.\nYou can't leave it to AI. So you have to like, it's like more like an autonomous car, right? So they're driving it and you had to like an eye on it and continuously see and if needed take a word, right?\nI mean, I think it has not reached there yet as a coder. It's far less superior than that.\n\n@10:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut so we have some of the senior coders in the org have actually recorded their sessions.\n\n@10:46 - Soumya Das\nThat's how they have actually some really complex business logic implementation using co-pile.ca. And where they have showed like, like at\nHow do you, how do you from them to get something done and then when you get, you get the code, so how do you intervene and connect some of them and essentially, so what, like what was easily could have taken, say, eight hours or so, so one example that I'm saying, which could have taken a day to complete like a, okay, what, took around 1.5 hours, okay, so what would you like for, I guess, like, go ahead, like you said, go ahead, yeah, but it depends on the person who is using it, how they are using it.\nSo, I think at an org world, we have to benchmark and understand and come up with a goal, which is a work in progress.\n\n@11:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's where the question was coming, so what is your opinion, mean, is it like, junior developers with this tool are able to give a better ROI or senior developers with that tool are able to do better what is what is your your understanding so far I think it's not about junior senior it's about how people want to embrace the new things how okay they are of how faster they embrace those things it matters mostly that ideally not nothing to do with junior seniority right so with seniority also a thing might play along that and some of them they have some mindsets and they will think no it doesn't work they might not try out enough so all of that things are also there it's I mean primarily about who is embracing how how much they are embracing it's not mostly about how much experience they have to test it out because mostly the output is\nrate that we are getting or isn't that we have to work more on the output, maybe it can solve errors and we have to work focused on that, how is it playing out for you?\n\n@13:20 - Soumya Das\nAre you there? Yeah, I'm here, I lost you. you have a question? Yeah, I think what you asked was, is the output has got errors or not?\nIf it's a very simple task.\n\n@13:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMy question was around the fact that, we are getting some output out of the LLM, right? Now, a senior person would have more experience and also more, let's say, determination not to be there, probably say, this is better, right?\nAnd the junior will get a lot of information on the front, but the end, the end otherwise. will depend on key, and I was only used here and how much they are able to get out of it.\nthe end ROI, let's feel is better. mean is it not a matter of who is experienced or not, just a matter of how well you use it, right?\n\n@14:14 - Soumya Das\nHow well you use it and how determined you want to use it effectively.\n\n@14:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGot it, got it. And other than coding, is there anywhere else you found that, hey, this is doing great wonders for me.\n\n@14:30 - Soumya Das\nYeah, there are some anecdotal evidence of where things have been doing, pretty good. I think we have this open, okay, I deep, deep I was playing around with the deep research, which is a bit expensive, but then, I mean, the kind of, so on a product, more from a product management standpoint.\nWe wanted to do a really good competitive landscape analysis on a specific thing. think it did a pretty good job which would have to do it manually, let all the information, put it in order to talk and summarizing all of that.\nwould have taken some decent amount of time which it got done in 15 minutes.\n\n@15:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd was the data fairly accurate, purely accurate, almost there?\n\n@15:29 - Soumya Das\nYeah, it was fairly accurate because it actually referenced all the external things. I mean, it's definitely used RAG and got the right things.\nI didn't see any hallucitation at least on that front.\n\n@15:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAwesome. Great, great. So, is coding that you said, the other is basic brainstorming or researching, right?\n\n@15:57 - Soumya Das\nYeah, getting some ground truth, not really inference. something like getting some ground truth like doing the analysis on and like I was trying out perfect sleeping a bit also I mean that also seem decently good to because it removes the hallucinations in some ways and I get the raw data.\n\n@16:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo this one is coding the other is ground truth getting research out right not inference anything else that you feel is giving a good ROI to you.\n\n@16:39 - Soumya Das\nThe one thing that I should personally note there is really helpful one I mean it's just summarize is I know the action items I don't need to always take notes while at discussion during discussion which was really important effectively basically yeah now if we are able to tangibly put things up.\nSo tangibly how much time would it save including if you would say in terms of okay a rough idea of what I could have done in next time I am able to do and buy time today overall Well like I told you right I mean we are still measuring that but we have some goals and it completely varies from person to person it might have happened actually one person might actually taking more time because they are not able to get the prompt right they are like getting too many the output is not meaningful and then you are there iterating iterating and correcting it might be taking longer but then like I said this this this person put it say say x more than five x faster right so I think we we still don't have an understanding of what should be the right goal and what should be the goal or\nwide but we what we realize is so it's if we don't feel that I think there's a lot of scare in the market that I will replace jobs and all of it.\nI think what the way I see it is and the engineers who are able to use it effectively will actually replace the engineers who can't.\nIt's essentially that so it right now to draw baseline is not what we know what should be that baseline and as we know and understand that baseline and then that would also like impact their performance as well right like the performance management the rating and every pound of the engineers will heavily depend on it.\n\n@18:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut then generally giving a direction so far Abitak how do you feel it is it like a 10x improvement to x improvement Abitak from whatever you have seen so far.\nNo that's what I mean we have to measure right like so we have we have started measuring that.\n\n@19:00 - Soumya Das\nhow many lines of code are being written or accepted by the author, right, like so the edits that have been proposed by Billi, what is the acceptance rate.\nSo that is what we are trying to measure right now and we see very varied numbers. So it's all over the place, right, and it's also not consistent even for a single developer across days.\nSo yeah, I mean, we have to draw the baseline first. I can say anything, but that doesn't matter.\n\n@19:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMinister makes sense.\n\n@19:42 - Soumya Das\nSo once you establish the baseline, so I feel, generally feels, which is easily possible, like that's like at an org wide, so X is possible.\nSo which is essentially a big boost, like say if you are able to do two X of the things.\nSo you don't need to, if every junior kind of really embraces it and the overall odd speed is 2x, you essentially can build 2x more things.\nAnd my tech debt was totally ambitious with that. Well, that is, that is also debatable right at this point.\nYes, we are trying to generate test cases, but then so they are reading test cases looking at the code, right?\nIt's not looking at the specification as much of the PRDF search, right? Like so, so yeah, I mean, so that's the next thing that we will try to do, right?\nLike so, so from PRD, how much can we get something done? And that's when we will try to realize, which means also that the product managers, entire ecosystem needs to\n\n@21:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nright in a way which can be used as prompts or the JNI tools right like so there's a lot of like everyone I'm bracing that that thing is important else you don't get the benefit right right that's that's great so I'll move on to that now and as a culture right I have talked to many CEOs and CTOs and as a culture what I'm able to get is that three main ways of putting things forward one is where the organization says us you have to use JNI because if you are not using JNI then you are losing something and I am losing something in return right that's one way of saying this the other segment is where the organization doesn't care whether you use a JNI or not as long as you are able to give me this level of stuff I am fine JNI usage or not is your third level is where I see that organizations are not very much for it is a\nSo you please don't use Janaya, rather do it, right, and give me the human return thing or human return code or whatever.\nSo where do you place yourself in this spectrum, right? Many people in between.\n\n@22:15 - Soumya Das\nI think we are an extreme, we want to say that if you are not using these tools essentially your skills will be a thing is what we try to position it because I mean we are seeing benefits of it.\nLike I said, it's the more we embrace the better or why we get out of it and if you are not embracing, if you are not making that cultural shift to embrace it, we will never get the benefit and the companies would do it actually will win the game.\n\n@22:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut we still do not have a tangible ROI that we can we can calculate, right, but we have Directional ROI that we see, hey, this directionally, this is going well.\n\n@23:04 - Soumya Das\nYeah, so this is always about two things, like, so you don't initially get a very, like, I mean, you have to understand the base lines, you have to, like, believe in it, you have to see the early signs and then build on top of it, then being like, you, you try to look for metrics which don't matter, gets you to a wrong path, right?\nSo, so you first try to understand how things are being used, what metrics may matter, and then you try to set up goals for those metrics and that's when you have to take the real benefit out of it.\nI think we are, we have that mindset.\n\n@23:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo, that's it. That's a very good one. There's a lot of, a lot of companies are actually succeeding with that mindset.\nSo in terms of such things, what is the strategic goal that you may, I can help you achieve the biggest strategic goal?\nWe'll see you. We are like I said we are an AI company and we are we essentially try to automate the physical economy which is a tough thing to do.\n\n@24:15 - Soumya Das\nWe are bringing AI and automation into the physical economy and like for example like we are also using AI to make lines of our customers better, right from say they have a so so the physical economy depends on a lot of paperwork too right and their paperwork and then they have different workflows and essentially all of that is very manual and physical and not automated and all of it.\nSo what we are essentially trying to do is you just upload the documents we can classify the documents the right way we can read it we know like which documents should trigger what workflow whom to send what to do.\n\n@25:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nand all of that, right?\n\n@25:02 - Soumya Das\nSo, think of the productivity pool that comes that our customers can have with that process, right? So, if we believe in that and we don't follow that same path, which is like being an hypocrite in some ways.\nAbsolutely. So, yeah, mean, we're building the tools for our customers and we believe that it's doable, achievable, we can achieve the same thing with our internal use of the products.\nSo, think that's why we are very, very bullish about it.\n\n@25:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, AI has been our part of strategy.\n\n@25:35 - Soumya Das\nSo, AI has been our all our strategy. So, like I said, like ultimately, it's a productivity boost.\n\n@25:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, the goal is to move the productivity boost more. Yep. Okay.\n\n@25:49 - Soumya Das\nAnd for our customers, too. I mean, see, I mean, it's so these are the three things that we do for our customers, two AI.\n\n@25:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, we boost their productivity.\n\n@26:00 - Soumya Das\nWe boost their profitability and we make them safer, okay, so that's how we use AI. And I can tell you how, say with what we do with on the profitability, it's not just the productive use, like say more money, no, so there are other ways.\nSo we understand fraud in their systems, we understand the best vendors for them so that they can actually optimize their spendings, which is really a profitability to us, productivity I talked about, and then safety like I was selling, like these different safety areas, coaching the drivers and all of that.\nSo there are privacy areas where we are impacting our customers, like we are helping our customers with our AI products.\n\n@26:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd for us, yes, I think the first thing that we are focusing on is\n\n@27:00 - Soumya Das\nproduct. That's great.\n\n@27:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd if you look at the past, right, is there something you would say that hey, this is a great achievement or you would say no, we are still not calling anything a great achievement so far.\nI think it's still a journey.\n\n@27:16 - Soumya Das\nWe have not ended. have not reached the destination yet.\n\n@27:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd have we tried to interleave this into our operation in terms of HR, in terms of operations, in terms of other things, other departments.\n\n@27:32 - Soumya Das\nYeah, mean, we are trying to do every bit of it, right? say productivity is a very, I mean, see you strong to some sense, but but I mean, we are like, for example, say, so we use this, we have this spintech product also, which is a fuel card with charge.\nour customers who are three customers essentially. If they use it at our partner locations for refilling, they get a discount.\nNow, so we have a picture of our customers, we have to show them the R1. Now, that is a very manual process of the sales team, the finance team to go through what are their current spendings are, where do they spend, how much do they buy, and then what can be the probable savings.\nSo we can essentially read their current card statements, all of that through J&A and then figure it out, analyze it, and create a report of what can be their savings.\n\n@28:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, huge amount of manual work just got done. Absolutely.\n\n@28:47 - Soumya Das\nAnd a significant, well, I mean, obviously, it's not like we are able to do it with 100% of the cases, but we have achieved 40% automation, right?\nAnd that's a huge... Now, for those 40% customers, we can get back to them with a code way faster, and we can now process more deals than we could have done.\n\n@29:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThen you say way faster is it like ours to days kind of a conversion or one of those days to our days to our days to our days to our okay.\nAnd in terms of your proprietary data being shared outside or other policies where you would be sensitive towards what you are sharing with the NLM or not, how sensitive are you to that kind of stuff?\n\n@29:41 - Soumya Das\nNo, we are very sensitive about it. So that's why we have a very well laid out policies, which tools to use and for of our data is being used, and we have been doing.\ntrainings for our employees so that they adhere to the policies and just random leaders and sign up for a tool and start new rules.\n\n@30:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe enforcement sector that we do all is just trainings and we push the data to their behavior. This is how you should behave or do things.\n\n@30:16 - Soumya Das\nYeah, see, mean, enforcement like being updated, I mean, we are recently signed enterprise a serving enterprise customer. So our data security has always been, it's not like anyone can come and like get the data and push it to something else.\nLike so everything, only if they have, we have an enterprise integration, they can read our data otherwise not. That is any way secure, like for anything, not just on an LLM and creating their own personal account but sharing sound.\nConfidential information with that NLM that can still happen.\n\n@31:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, there is no policy.\n\n@31:05 - Soumya Das\nThat's where you need to train them Okay, so which and which we have been actively doing?\n\n@31:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, make sense. So we'll come to the last section of this And this is more of your opinion and if you want to substantiate your opinion, that's absolutely fine.\nThat'll be great, right? So in your insight, what is the what is the hardest hurdle to get Jedi on loaded and working for you?\nWhat is the hardest hurdle that you have to cross?\n\n@31:35 - Soumya Das\nI think I think the psychological barrier has been the I see, I mean, if people have had tried or spent a lot of energy and many a few years back would have failed because it was not great.\nOkay, and the number of tokens and NLM can handle it right now. mean, things have been improving and will be improving.\nmore in the next couple of years, right? So, if people were trying to adopt it and a couple of years back, mainstream probably would have struggled and spent a lot of money, got frustrated.\nI don't know if in those cases are there and then maybe they drop the ball, right? So, I think starting at the right time where you have that good ROI and then the psychological barrier that gets, I mean, a lot of people I see around me as well, even in my friends and all, it's a nay you are coaching me over, like this will just scrap and it will never succeed.\nAnd well, I'm not saying, you see, to replace humans, it is not like, I know there are a lot of info that made of because all of that can be done by, yeah, I don't believe in that stuff though, but it can definitely help you being our\n\n@33:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwe are faster executed on not just on trading coding on many fronts and I have been doing that myself so I know that yes I am able to do more so which which means that it's possible it's real now how much I don't know yet that is the baseline tree we are trying to figure out and and sorry but if you start if you don't believe in it you'll never embrace it today that starts true for anything any new thing that comes in the world exactly right so you don't want to oh 2010 way Bitcoin bit investment yeah right I feel that myself like oh 2010 bit time investment so if you if you would measure what would be a good way of measuring in time\nHow would you have measured your success if you would not be measuring or you have measured already?\n\n@34:08 - Soumya Das\nYeah, I mean, I won't say I have to quantitatively but qualitatively I can say I can give a tab of more things now than like primarily because of the no taker it has really that I do this thing for like for example if I have to say we are having a discussion like a leadership discussion we wanted to look at some data it's right now the like that's what is not ready I want to quickly get something right so I don't need to depend on thing done that I that's true that's true so which is and yes\nI mean, obviously, I'm also a techy. So for a complete non-techy might not be possible because they won't understand issues, the errors in that output.\nBut then it would just take me 10, 15 minutes to get that fix and have a query written. Or like I have done also similar customer research, and it just saved me hours.\n\n@35:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt does, it does, and that's absolutely valid. It's mostly in terms of, hey, I do the same thing in X amount of time and the same thing in my amount of time, with the similar quality.\nI'm keeping the quality stable, right? No. OK, what is the biggest revelation that you have had with Jenny and I coming in?\nI mean, that has been like as late as this weekend, just before this weekend.\n\n@35:56 - Soumya Das\nAnd actually, I was just like. uh discussing with my product counterpart about about a hackathon that we could have done we could have done that in the hackathon um or i'll total this idea in a hackathon so um and then and then i said yeah i mean like you if you i mean you can say this like you can show this visually and to inspire some of the engineers is it visually i mean so i said yeah well it lets you something like lovable and all and man like i i was pretty pretty surprised that uh i just wrote like maybe 10 bullet points as a prompt and i had a good nice y at something to play around i could get it done in 30 minutes yeah you should try v0 by version version is really really good at it now okay\nyeah i mean i i didn't know things i've gone this far like across all these you might have done i think yeah i think i had to try more and more of these i mean this is strong recommendation go for v0 by myself it's free you don't have to pay for it right now but you will see this i i i i i i just took a like the monthly subscription or lovable because it was like very nice but yeah i mean i i think it has gone it's making some good progress but i then i tried to give more inputs and i was thinking that it was able to it was not able to generate the right output either something some you had or the other was breaking so yes there are limitations it's not like it's a silver bullet which we'll solve this zero will be much different trust me it's much much better than lovable right out got it yeah sure so thanks one very very fun question and that is you have the knowledge that you have right\n\n@38:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nnow but you are thrown one year back in the past. What would you do differently now?\n\n@38:09 - Soumya Das\nOn what terms exactly?\n\n@38:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you have the knowledge of Gennai right now right and with this knowledge you can go one year back.\nWhat would you do differently after going one year back?\n\n@38:21 - Soumya Das\nOkay we got it. Well I needed to have these tools to do things differently. mean like I said one thing that like for example say Uber or Ola wouldn't have been successful if they had launched the product 30 years back right like even if that idea came there is everything the time has to be right for it.\nSo I think the tools were not as matured as it is today right and then and this will keep on changing every, every six months even like, I mean, and things are just like drastically change in the next five years.\ndon't know what's going to happen.\n\n@39:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCan't So, any, any difference or would be the same, not major difference?\n\n@39:19 - Soumya Das\nSay, say, say, for example, that's what I'm saying. Like say, if I had the similar tools, but I mean, the rest of the world wouldn't have adopted it.\nI would have tried to take in the benefit of it and doing at least two X more things for the for the company, right, which means they are delivering two X more features.\nA year back, obviously would have made somewhat a difference in the top line for the company for sure.\n\n@39:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, And my final question to you, for any company he was trying to get on the Gen Z bandwagon, right, what would be your do's and do's?\nSo, can you elaborate the question a little bit more? So, let us say I'm company, I'm trying to use Gen AI for my digital transformation, I'm trying to do stuff with it, maybe internally, maybe externally, what would be your advice that, I think, see, mean, the basic things are I would say just don't get good swayed away by the, by Gen AI, I think you didn't time consuming thing that you do today, okay, and where you think\n\n@41:00 - Soumya Das\nautomation is possible where you believe that automation is possible and focus on those areas. I mean I don't think a company should first without them understanding it well or should try to solve any customer pain point because they might mostly get it wrong and try to use it in a way that not so not optimal because they have to use it they won't know how to use it they won't know how it can deliver customers yeah so so that's why I feel like look internally like key your bottlenecks and try to fix those bottlenecks and whether whether genia gets into fixing things bottlenecks I think that's a very good start right and what should they not do by your naked man I mean everything else make unlikely but then just for the sake of using genii or like the cool to your\nemployees and to everything and just just say that we have to use JMAI without a direction that how to use as JMAI.\n\n@42:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, direction is very important without a direction for the entire organization, you should not just try and get the key and look for a lock, right?\n\n@42:23 - Soumya Das\nWe should know what do you want to unlock first and then only I find the key for it.\n\n@42:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nA lot of places people are doing that, they're looking for the lock after they have the key. Thank you so much.\nThis has been great. Thank you for taking our time by working. This is like very, very helpful. Thank you.\nMy pleasure.\n\n@42:48 - Soumya Das\nIt was nice talking to you.\n\n@42:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSame here. Same here, man. So, okay.\n\n@42:52 - Soumya Das\nmean, let's understand. What is your background? What exactly? So, you said you are doing this research with the ITD.\n\n@42:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right. So I said I've been in technology for around 27 years and mostly so early part of my career had been in media.\nwas with Han Gaba, was with Penske Media, right? And then I was so you have been in engineering roles?\nI have been in I have I'm still in engineering I still put my hands into food were required. Specifically the last four years has been very very deep into JNI.\nconsult with a multiple I mean I consult with a number of companies for their implementation. if somebody is having a problem with their JNI implementations they consult me generally.\nThat's how it has been for the last few years. I've been into JNI with teaching have been into JNI with the communication have been into JNI I was writing books like there's a lot of enterprise features.\nThis code solutions, a lot of things basically, all over the place in terms of JNI. last few years has been entirely JNI and I was trying to do my PhD with IIT Delhi.\nSo, before the PhD, I wanted to understand by Kirtana, Laghini, Ali, before from Ghuzja Kendra of India, and then was hey, you are doing a PhD and this is not bad.\nAll right, my education is slightly non-standard. So, I'll tell you the story if you have a few minutes. Yeah, sure.\nI left my education after class to work in Bhagya that I said. It's true. Interesting. I created companies, I then one day decided to work for companies, then I decided to consult.\nI had lot of technology, but I was 12th And I started my education. When my daughter was born, he was earning great, you have a good number of people who respect you.\nAfter he passed, to it. Okay, right?\n\n@45:11 - Soumya Das\nSo that's when you talk to the Christian man. Yeah, so I started my education after he was born.\n\n@45:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI did my archilist first. did my archilist first, archilist first, my archilist I did archilist my first, did my archilist first, my archilist first, they did my archilist first, he born.\nthat's the story behind my education. So it's so nice. Very nice story.\n\n@45:46 - Soumya Das\nVery weird story, I would say. Sorry, sorry, I mean... mean... ...we couldn't catch up earlier. We are absolutely fine.\n\n@45:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nand life will settle.\n\n@46:00 - Soumya Das\nGive me a game and then we could catch up.\n\n@46:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMaybe you said that you think I don't know if I'm my bath cap or something. Okay, then he told me you're not well, so I don't know if I'm going to disturb you.\nI don't know if I'm don't I'm to don't know if I'm going to you.

        "content": "Transcript\nParag - July 25\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 74 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:00 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nalready I'm a little late I got stuck in something else so do you want to keep it a note here take it out what do want to do we can take it out we can take depending on what you need I think tension is talking about the role right now or about interview because we might not have enough time for the interview like 45 minutes would be miniminated for that okay okay I'll just ask a one quick thing first and then we can go to interview so let's do the interview first because you want to do first interview right my question to you I'm sorry so let's do the interview I can do the 45 minutes interview but I just need like quick two minutes I want you to think and we can always connect separately on it so there are a few things you know in flux and my side in terms of the the role here I was and again\nWe can talk in more detail a bunch of things about it. I was, it looks like you are doing a few things right now, would you be interested in at least getting started more on a contracting gig so that you know us a little bit more, we know you a little bit more in terms of, you know, a few things that we are trying to do around search and AI assistant and so on.\nIt doesn't have to be, you know, it doesn't have to be full week. If you say, hey, I want to do just try it out for a half a week, right, I'm just technically saying 20 hours, we don't know whatever it is, it's something like that where you will know a little bit about us and it doesn't have to be, you know, I'm not talking about a long term thing, right, as in short term thing because I have some complication on my side in terms of, you know, the role and so on and that is the reason this has got stuck.\nThere are a few deliverables that we are working on with respect to our enterprise search GA as well as our AI assistant GA.\nAnd again, I don't need the answer right now, Vicky, you want to think and maybe, you know, email me or something, then that's one option for us to get started, where you will know us a little bit more, and you know, captain, but you will know us a little bit more, you will know the role.\nIt will also give us an opportunity to, you know, get to you know you better. And the only reason I'm suggesting this, by the way, it looks like you are also busy with a few other things.\n\n@2:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I'll be very frank, first of all, I really appreciate you being upfront, because at your position, it's very hard to get people who are so upfront.\nI really know.\n\n@2:41 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI'm trying my best to figure out how to make this happen, okay, and things have got various reasons, and I don't want to get into those details, various reasons.\nSo, I wanted to at least put this as an option in front, now you may say yes or no, and then we can decide based on that, what are the other options, right?\n\n@2:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm pretty clear on this part. So, the reason I'm taking this break, don't know what I told you, I'm taking this break, I'm taking it easy right now is because I want to now get into the next phase of my life where I will stick to something and by the time my daughter grows up, I'm there and I'm finishing that, I don't want to be moving around and focusing on different things, want to be focusing on one thing that I can really contribute value, that's one, right?\nI believe that's a goal, to reach that goal I understand that you might have to probably push to the organization of whichever way, hey, this is a choice that I have and the choice is doing gold, so maybe I would want to bring it, and if that is that is the intention that you have, I am here to support you.\nI said I'm absolutely here to support you on that, but the intention of the end goal that I would have is more focus on, let's say if I want to do this, if you have a larger role you think, hey Vicki, this is where you can spend the next four to five years and you can really add value, I would love to go ahead with it, I'll to reach that,\nif we need to do this smaller gig where we refine and we work out on things just to prove value or add what business value can be brought on board and I'm game with it.\nBut the intention or the end goal should be that.\n\n@4:12 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo let me ask you a simple thing right? I know you have taken a break and you are looking for the next big bit which is more of a long term gig in your mind high level what was the what's your timeline for you to end your break?\n\n@4:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI will be very fine with you again. mean we have had. I have been open on it right and I wanted that within at least by the time let's say October by the end of let's say the third quarter of the year right?\nI finalized on something.\n\n@4:47 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nOkay okay. That's the second timeline I'm looking at Yes you are doing tons of things but not like fully.\nfully busy. Is that correct? That's correct.\n\n@5:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm not fully fully busy. I'm doing a few consulting gigs here and there just to keep myself occupied, not for any other reason, right?\ngovernment gigs and something else, but I have time in hand.\n\n@5:13 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo if you let's say there was no simpler here, then we were not talking, we didn't know each other based on your October timeline.\nHow soon would you be in the job market in a very serious way to find what is the right long term?\n\n@5:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet us say in November, I don't know, you said you want to actually start a new gig by October, right?\nLet's say mid October, in that case. Okay, mid October, okay.\n\n@5:46 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI'm just thinking loud here, okay, totally real time as in, so if I go with your assumption that you want by mid October, you want to see to it that\nyou have the right long-term gig whatever it is that the right fit for you and if there was no simpler means you will reach out to whatever your network whatever it is at least four weeks or so before that right as in that will you might just like say mid-September is you would start reaching out to your network saying hey I need to here I'm looking for whatever you're looking for right doesn't let me let me show those timeline basically mid-October is when I would start reaching out to them seriously to look around and I would I would say in so just to answer your question and I would say that my sharp deadline of actually joining somewhere would probably be November medium right in that case because I would like to start October mid to start reaching out to my network and I'll tell you why I'm thinking this way okay and why I was asking this question so if I say hey we could start on some very specific thing where based on and you can come back and say based on your timeline we could do August September as an example I'm just\nmaking it up here, right? 60 days. That's good enough time for you to know us, us to know you, and for me to kind of figure out that role for you, right?\nHonestly. Now what could happen at the end of September is either you really like us, we really like you, the role is the right way, you see that whatever, four-year horizon, and everything is hunky-dory, you don't need to go out and look as long as we can settle on the comp and all that, as in it's a straightforward thing, or you may find out in four to six weeks, then this is not the right place for me, this is not my idea of what I want to do for the next long term, right?\nIn terms of providing value, it's not going to be the right thing. Then we could still fit your time and say, okay, it's what it is.\nIs that something you think would be something that we could think about?\n\n@7:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n@7:53 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nBecause then it's a very fair thing, right? we are both giving each other between six to eight weeks max.\nto do it, it either works and the six to eight weeks turns into a full-time role or six to eight weeks doesn't work but it's still on your timeline, the only difference is going to be we will get some value out of you and hopefully you will get some money out of it.\n\n@8:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's absolutely fine, that's absolutely fair because on your end hiring at that role that you are trying to you would really need to do the person and what exactly is being delivered in terms of business values and absolutely fine with it.\n\n@8:29 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAnd I will also tell you I actually have achieved and I'm being super honest here, super honest and I, I already have achieved with a scientist who's been with us for two and a half years, he actually came through one of our VCs who is an investor in the company.\nOkay, so that is the complication I'm trying to figure out how to make it work because the chances are if this role is figured out that if I come up with a new role which you know then most probably he's going to think he doesn't have a role, no matter how I try to do it, right?\nSo, it's a significant. So, I was just trying to figure out how could we do this?\n\n@9:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have that that makes a question come in my head again in the in the interest of us being upfront.\ndon't think we have to say it again, but I'm just put you open with you. If you bring any into this temporary role, how would you manage the flow of power in this case because I know because I know what I will want you to help us.\n\n@9:24 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSee, you are based on what we talked in the past, you have good experience in terms of search, you have to work on AI assistant, some of those pieces.\nWe are actually working through some interesting challenges in that space. So, I will give you an example. We are rolling out our enterprise search with multiple characters and so on.\n\n@9:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust the first phase of it, like it that is all work to be done right the initial phase.\n\n@9:47 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWe are running into some challenges in the quality and so on. Our actual GA was supposed to be literally this week.\nWe posted out my and the more I talk to the team and I talk to couple also. I think we need some.\nsome outside person to come in, take a look at if you are doing things right, not doing things right, expertise there, which I feel we are missing internally, okay.\nSo if even if I don't, even if you are not the right person, either way I will go out and get somebody to help a short term, the only difference between you and somebody else is that other person is surely short term, while you could potentially turn into full term, that's how I'm looking at it.\n\n@10:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat works both ways, I mean it works from my schedule, because there's so many things.\n\n@10:29 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo why don't we do this wiki, let's go through the interview and you will need it 45 minutes. You still sleep over what I asked you, okay, if you want to take a day or so.\n\n@10:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is, I mean I already told you very clearly that I have an end goal and if this is a path to reach that end goal, it works for me.\n\n@10:48 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYeah, this doesn't kind of spoil your timetable in terms of what either way is going to work.\nACTION ITEM: Think about contracting gig for 2-4 weeks and compensation amount - WATCH\n\n@10:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo in the end of October, if we have some gig that we are working out on and I'm absolutely open to it.\nOkay.\n\n@11:00 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo, then one thing I get from you and I don't need the answer right now, this you should certainly think, if you can come back to me in a end of the day whatever it is, which is the higher level if we were doing this 8v contracting, what would it be in terms of comp, at least I could get started on that and then come think through it, don't give me an answer right now, you are a very fast guy, so think through it, what would the comp look like, so I can figure out what it is and I am assuming you don't have your, you are not like, we have your company or something or like we would like or just I working directly with you.\nI working directly with you, that's it right, so it's like, it's not some x, y, z, ink, it is wiki that I am working with in terms of a, because that is the other piece I just have to work out in terms of how it, what the actual logistics in terms of how we end up taking it, that's all.\n\n@11:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, these two can come back to me right, perfect, I'll do that and I'll get back to you plus, I'm not always that fast right.\nThe only reason that for this question, I was able to go fast was because I have been mulling it over for a long period of time, right?\nmean, since April, this is something I'm daily doing, right? I'm planning around, totally, I'm working with IIT on these things.\nI'm talking to people, I'm evaluating, trying to understand. So it's something that's going on regularly in my hand and hence the quick answer.\n\n@12:24 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI think that we can say, I also like the second, I'll say that to you right now, there's a lot of clarity of thought, right?\nSo, you know, that generally helps. And I told Kapil, I'll meet, I was meeting you today. I am very open and transparent.\nmean, I don't try to, I told you my plan. is it, hopefully it works. Maybe it doesn't, but it doesn't spoil your timeline in terms of what you just told.\n\n@12:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, that's exactly what I love, Parag and I mean, I must, and again, I've done it earlier, but I must compliment on the honesty because at your role, it is very hard to be that honest.\nAnd I'm really, really. I it. I mean, most times it works.\n\n@13:02 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYou know, you're not trying to do some crazy manipulation anything, but I'm just giving you as is what it is.\nanyway, let's go through what you're looking for.\n\n@13:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSure. So, let me give me a minute to just open up because I'm not, I was just waiting. I get a clarity from you on what you want.\nOkay. That sets me up. Perfect. So, um, provisionally, I cut the first part of the recording off and I will use the second part for this.\nUm, so, but at the while, while being on this, I wanted to spend my time on doing something that interest me, right, because, and again, the eventual goal I will be very upfront with you and frank with you.\nI wanted to do PhD through my IT daily, but for 2010, they're like me, it's not possible. And I'm being upfront with you.\nThis I have not told anybody else in the, I mean, anybody at all. Oh, why is it not possible for you?\n\n@14:07 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI'll explain those to you. I'll explain those points to you.\n\n@14:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo three things, right? One, my age, most of the PhD students are much younger, right? And the professor has invested in them because they know that they are more inclined towards that and the age is younger.\nThey don't have that many responsibilities. So that's one of the reason. The second reason is I would do only part time.\nI will not do full time because I have to live my family. I want to do my work.\n\n@14:32 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI don't want to leave my work.\n\n@14:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's very important for me because that's where I enjoy. Third thing is because my education through, I would, as I told you, I left my education after class 12, right?\nAnd I only started when my daughter was born. And since then to now it has been mostly remote education formally, right?\n\n@14:51 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAs it has been.\n\n@14:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo these three factors contribute to it and I understand and it's fair. It's not unfair on their part or all these keywords because if they are thinking\nin somebody, they won't carry chances of closing or higher, whereas in the past, they have seen that these three factors, the chances of closing are lower.\nI appreciate it. I mean, I totally am not against it. So the way I had posted it is I started a program with IIT, the lead, the CTO program, right?\nI knew I will get direct access to a professor and I will be able to directly face it with him and tell him my own feeling what I want.\nAnd I was able to do it. And he said, okay, great. Ricky, let's start writing a paper. You will get a feel of exactly what you and I have in conversation on.\nYou will get a feel of whether you want to do that larger PhD or not. Let's watch those smaller research, right?\nAnd let's see how well we go across with that research. And if we feel that, hey, this research is working out and it seems good, right?\nAnd you feel that, hey, I will really be able to work and do my PhD together with this. Then you take the decision and then we will see how I can help you get into that.\nSo that was are understanding and I mean a friend I have not told this to anybody else but that's to be clear with you now this is what the interview is about right and the interview is so LLM has come up bit time right everybody is like LLM Gaga I want to do this I want to do this but in reality in reality on the ground what has been tried and how much it has been helped that's the first part second part with all the hype and with everything that we hear and we we get to ourselves what is it that at the next level if everything goes hunky-dory now this is the fact where everything goes hunky-dory what is it that I would expect at the next level for it to contribute to my business when so these are two different aspects which I will cover through different questions I will that's it's the yeah yeah yeah it does I was also thinking yeah let's do the interview let's see how it goes because I was also thinking because a lot of this is going to require a little bit of\nnot thinking and putting things in but that's how we can we can look at it can I ask you one question before you go and you can decide what to answer I you have passion for learning right I can see the books behind you you talked about it and so on but why do you need to do a PhD correct again I mean we have been upfront I don't let me say that again I at the later part of my age want to teach I have been pitching in the earlier part of my age right I do it right now also I don't so I mean I have a lot of employees who had worked with me now they are distributed some of them have their own companies they come and say I keep doing those things I mean I'm I'm in touch with all of them I keep doing those things I and I have really seen a big gap in terms of what the industry needs as a director of to lovely university and what the college is churning out is a huge this gap right but the budget engineering pass again you can get me but\nSo, somebody has to bridge in that gap. at the later age, at the later part of my age, I want to actually sit down and get into a college and do all that, right?\nAnd this is just something to prepare me on, you know, academics case, have my car, I'm lucky, you make a phone and how would you balance it?\n\n@18:18 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThere's an answer you question?\n\n@18:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, it does.\n\n@18:21 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nIt just a more of a thing because see, I have had friends who have so much passion for learning, right?\nThey will do a PhD, will like to do a post-doc, and there are also, I have friends who found it difficult to do a bachelor's.\nBut if you look at the knowledge level, right, just in terms of the, that really isn't a difference. It is just how you gain knowledge, right?\nAbsolutely.\n\n@18:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd I think that you already heard my story about me not studying at all. I mean, formally studying, because I was the head of technology for graduate.\nmean, before I was the graduate, the only reason I started studying Was my daughter bullying that you have not studying and you never did your after class because you didn't study and you are earning well And everything is happening so that clarity of thought hitting you and she was born right and I started my education I had told you when I did my bachelor's and then my post-class and my MBA and all and that's continuing since then so the passion of learning vis-a-vis the passion of Academy Is I two different things I don't mix them learning is something that continue and I don't care about a degree for that But this is more about teaching later on so that I get the past year Okay, so just to get this started what is the industry and sector that we are working in right now so the Industries technology and the sector that we are primarily focused on is more around employee experience So, how do we make it easier?\n\n@20:00 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nfor employees to do their job, be more engaged, more productive. So it kind of covers sectors, in terms of business sectors, pretty much every sector, it's it's applicable.\nBut the core focuses around communication HR and IT technology.\n\n@20:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, I'll also keep taking a few notes so that I can get back. Okay, what would be a rough company size, probability known and a rough number of people that we are having right now?\n\n@20:35 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWe are a series D company, around 500 employees, that little less than 500 employees with an annual recurring revenue in the higher double digits in millions, higher double digit millions.\nOkay, thank you for sharing that.\n\n@20:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. Now, we slightly get deeper into the AI section of this is a classification so that we can classify the data that we are capturing and balance it across.\nNow, in terms of AI adoption, I mean, how do you see, I mean, are we early adopters, are we like now matured into what we have done, are we still totalling and we are moving ahead, how are we into the whole cycle right now?\n\n@21:23 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nIf you're looking at overall industry, as in my guess is when you say how are we today? I'm not overall industry.\nYou as in a V as in simpler. Okay, so that's an interesting question because in terms of actually using AI within our product and really leveraging some of the advances in AI, I would say that we have done a pretty good job.\nNow, I don't want to use the word mature because AI by itself as an industry is not made. It's in early days as in things change literally on a daily basis.\nBut as a company we have done a decent job in terms of using the advances in AI within our product to make it easier for employees to you know stay engaged reduce attrition and so on well enough where very recently we were recognized as the top 50 AI companies with some pretty marking names on that list so so that would tell you where we stand in terms of AI and then even gartner when you look at gartner report for our industry one of the strengths that they called out was our use of AI and what we are doing in that space but overall i don't want to add in i would still say even if we are doing pretty good we are not the you know the microsoft's of the googles of the world we're doing decent for our size as an industry it's in the early stage of course and this was just do video warm-up because we will now get into more details as in if you and if\n\n@23:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you remember the first part of the conversation we had, what exactly have we fried out in generative AI specific, but generative AI specific?\nAnd what of it has really contributed to the business value and how? And what of it has not actually worked a lot for us and we don't think that that's going to be that we're going to be using or something like that?\n\n@23:24 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo in terms of generative AI specifically, now simpler is in the business of like I said communication and impulse and so on, right?\nSo one area where a product is quite regularly used is content creation and that was one of our early use cases in terms of generative AI.\nNow think about an example where let's say there is the yearly benefits cycle and HR rolls out a benefit cycle.\nSo how do you generative AI to actually create the full communication part? So those are the things that were our early use cases and in terms of maturity, say that's.\na little bit more mature, right, as in you can create content, within our product, we have the capability where based on that company's values and the style of the company, et cetera, you can actually create content.\nSo it looks like it has been generated from within the company, All those things about it as a problem engineering, but using our product for problems here.\nSo that is something that has worked quite well, you know, it was one of the early things. Now, we also use generative AI in terms of some of the action-oriented use cases as in using the bot, how do I do this and so on.\nSo that is something that we are working on. That has been okay. think a lot of the generative AI use cases work very well for the 0 to 1, as anything about 0 to 1 as in demoing.\nYou can show great concept to a demo, but when you start looking at really getting it all ready for enterprise use cases, where accuracy\nsees needed, you can't screw up the answers. For example, if I'm working with an HR related customer and there are questions around benefits, the answer cannot be 95% accurate.\nIt has to be 100% accurate or no answer. I think those are the things where we still are struggling, I would say, because it has to be fully accurate or you just say, I don't have an answer.\nSo it is very different from a GPT or anything else where you don't know whether the answer is fully accurate.\nIn most cases, is not fully accurate. But it is OK for consumer use case, it doesn't matter. But if a question is asked, watch my 401k limit and if the answer is 22,000 and if the answer provided is 20,000, that's a big problem.\nSo those are the areas where I think there is still a lot of work to be done. Like I said, 0 to 1 easy, 1 to n, it does a lot of challenges.\nAnd I see the same, by the way, when I talk to my peers in the valley here, right? kind of everybody kind of sees the same thing up demo you could do like in 48 hours, but if truly wanted working at the enterprise level that takes a lot of effort.\n\n@26:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, just to be in the sense of disclosure I have been heading product for Jives right and there were simpler things we had done there and I totally agree with what you are saying here right.\nmean it's not that it's I mean we can take it to 95% right and and it does a great job but that 5% is a problem and specifically in terms of things like HR etc where you need so I mean there are ways that that worked around and we can talk about it later when we do so yeah.\nThis is absolutely what others are also feeling.\n\n@26:51 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWhat else did we actually causes an expectation mismatch because when you showed them those all people they go yeah it's easy why why can you not do this but\nthen that 5% is not easy.\n\n@27:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo if you if you look at the gartner height curve right it's like it's at the peak now there will be a disillusionment people will know that it doesn't do these things good so I mean they will come back to a regular flat world but the but the this disillusionment is still going on right now.\n\n@27:18 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWe are in the early series as in everybody talks here and so on we are in the very early series like take take development right there are so many tools available for writing code but they are not as you really need to work with them they are not like do work for you fully.\nACTION ITEM: Discuss ways to accurately measure productivity gains from generative AI tools - WATCH\n\n@27:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely so none of them are like specific specific they are so generic that I mean they don't even give you the right answer to the right code so we had worked in that aspect also.\nIn one of the projects we created a tool that actually takes in your issues right and within RCA it can actually generate the fix and pass from the peer and we were able to\ndo good at around 80% rate, which was nice. But that 20% consumes the time because you need to evaluate and you need to check and all those things goes across.\nAnd that's where things are still to be polished out and done well, right? one was content creation that you think that we did great.\nWhat was the kind of business value that you attained out of it? And my experience in earlier was the business value point is very hard because they're already generating content and now we're giving them a small feature which says, come here and clean this button and you get that content generated, right?\nAnd when we get back to them and say, let's say, X number of R is in some sense for them.\nBut in terms of us as simpler, what is the business value that we generated out of it?\n\n@28:46 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYeah, so when you say in terms of simpler, is it our calculation of what business value we generate for that?\n\n@28:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nokay. Or your business?\n\n@28:55 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYeah, so I look at, so this is one of the, and I don't remember what it was got now or someone else, but one of the,\nnon-publications, where almost 62% of the tasks that are done on a daily basis are like kind of the mundane repetitive tasks.\nSo, whole idea behind AI and the number could be 62, but the idea being it's a lot of tasks are very mundane repetitive tasks.\nSo, the idea being can you actually use some of these tools to reduce those tasks or they can do something else.\nSo, at least our way of looking at this, that's how we put it. Now, we also are using, you know, alternative AI for providing answers to questions where you can go in and say, okay, so many searches are done and we give you an immediate answer.\nWe are also looking at deflecting cases where you can say, okay, you know, 10,000 cases created using, you know, AI, we were able to deflect 2,000 of those cases.\nyou saved X, but at the end of it, you know, you could do all those calculations and show it, but it is still very difficult to say, I'll put it this way.\nto go to someone and say, hey, I have this cool AI, buy it for whatever $100,000 and you are going to make 10x of that, very, very difficult to actually do that, other than actually, you know, solving tickets or finding information, even finding information, search vendors struggle and authoring, how do you show the value of search in terms of, I found information.\nSo in that sense, it's a little difficult, but the value for us specifically is, we want to show we are that cutting edge company, we are doing things as the market is progressing, which helps sell the larger suite.\nSo we rarely go in and say, oh, our AI will, you know, give you a ROI of a million dollars, that's not how it works.\nSo that's not the unique setting point. So I know I gave you long answer, but the idea is not that easy to measure that value today.\n\n@30:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo for being there done that, I told you, I totally understand and that's why I started from that it's not easy to catch up.\nplayed the value across on this one. The way that generally I have been able to push customers with value was in terms of the dollar value.\nHey, you saved 30 minutes of the time of the guy who writes here this thing. And I mean, there are five guys writing and in a month you say blah, blah, blah, blah, this much, right?\nAnd in those terms, I have had customers come from that to me as well. Hey, yes, I am saving this much.\nI am able to do more, right? Or I have been able to reduce my workforce because I didn't need too much, right?\nAnd that not only in terms of this, for example, ticketing you raised a very, very interesting piece of it.\nEveryone can actually totally deal over it. Because anyone comes into that 60% of that muting tasks that you talk about where we are only checking, hey, is there or not?\nOkay, if it is there, then okay, I will pass you the answer or not. I'll say my engineers are looking at it or something.\nSo anyone can totally go, right? So in those terms, I got four items now. I got... content creation, I get action oriented bots, I got a box, finding information across so an exact answer to the information.\n\n@32:10 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo I think search is a big use case for all slides, finding information because information is all over the place, right?\nCan you actually take information across your data sources and find specific information? That you don't find information on a consistent basis, you don't need to have a conversation of hey, I'll save you million dollars, as simple as that.\n\n@32:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely, right? And then moving on to the fourth section, it was ticketing, right? Basically L1 cases of stuff, how much business value or what exactly have you been able to achieve through generative AI in ticketing and how much business value you have?\n\n@32:52 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWe are in the very early stages of it, we are doing in EA with a couple of customers there, for example, when I won't go into names.\nSo, finding things like pay stubs, etcetera, we are able to get that, it's a very early stages, it's not even something that we look at the value and so on.\nNow one other place where we use AI, not generative AI per se, is also in terms of measuring the overall engagement.\nSo, finding sentiment, doing sentiment analysis, know, personalization and things like that, which is again not very easy to measure, but helps with communication and engagement.\nBecause if we can, if a CEO, for example, sends out a note, if you can very quickly figure out, did the company understand what was the message, okay?\nIf somebody didn't understand, weren't they on a specific section of the blog, they didn't, but that's not as a generative AI, it's more of just pure AI.\n\n@33:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, there will be modules to get that, that's great, and I could really understand, because it's biggest problem that today's AI teams are having, right?\nAnd this is humongous in terms of size, because a lot of things, say that they do good AI, but the problem that they have is they don't measure properly, right?\nThe testing piece, the testing piece is so critical that, I mean, you need to, even if you put a comma or you change a model or you change the prompt, then it is very slight bit, right?\nOr you want to redirect something else, even if you run the same prompt again, right? You are not getting the right.\n\n@34:24 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYou just run the same prompt again, there is no guarantee, you get the same exactly. Absolutely, right?\n\n@34:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut how do you measure? And there are so many things, are hallucinations, retrieval qualities, they are malicious usage, there are so many different categories that we put things into, right?\nAnd they are not measuring it. What they are doing is, see, I put an answer, I got an answer, tested 10 questions, I'm done, see this is looking good.\n\n@34:47 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSee, that is what said, right? 0 to 1, which is making it a demoable product is very easy, but making an enterprise ready where it consists and works is very difficult.\n\n@34:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely. that's where, Most of these companies are really like, they're trying their best, but they're not able to get those out yet.\nOkay, so in terms again, so I understand that in terms of ticketing, it's very early and there's like not much business value.\nIn terms of Q&A, is humongous business value, but we have not put a number to it or try to quantify it yet.\nAnd in fact, Q&A will source a lot of your other things like ticketing will be sourced through Q&A some way.\n\n@35:27 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nBecause in Q&A, Q&A is your part of your virtual assistance or bot or it is workflow automation. you could actually use Q&A to do workflow automation and which goes back to it.\nI reduce tickets? I do things?\n\n@35:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAn IT person is not needed.\n\n@35:45 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo you can always do that, but I would say at least for simple, it's in the early stages. Now there are companies where their business is just that.\n\n@35:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFor us, our business is not just this.\n\n@35:55 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWe are adding AI around the use cases that we have for our business.\n\n@36:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, great. So I got five things, and one of them is only AI. got content creation. I got action-oriented bots.\ngot question answering, just finding information or such as you would call it. We have ticketing, where we are putting cases and we are doing stuff like those.\nIs there anything else that we spent our time into when we say, Hey, this at value or if we tried this, and we did a lot of things.\nBut this doesn't seem to be getting good.\n\n@36:32 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nNo, I would say those are good five use cases now within the Q&A. can be a pretty vast area, as in terms of virtual assistants.\nSo if I put, I'm specifically answering for simpler, but I know companies outside like me, there may be a testing company that may be looking at generative AI to create test cases or auto test cases.\nThere may be a security company that may be using generative AI for doing a better job in terms of overall security and so on, but specific to simpler, think those are the five steps.\n\n@37:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, right. And by the way, it's a maybe just a good question.\n\n@37:11 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYou will, as in simpler is not something that will be mentioned in the larger piece, right, because that is not something.\n\n@37:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is what I clarified in the first row. Your answers will be anonymized and generalized based on the category in which the company is, and we'll work for it.\nBut if we divide now, we have been talking overall in terms of the company providing, I mean, this is a way that is affecting the company itself as well, right?\nSo if we talk about the technology and infrastructure that we are using to build these solutions, is generative AI affecting it in some way?\nAre there some things that we are using some challenges that we have?\n\n@37:52 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo within the company, there are two parts. One is a group that is building the actual product. So think engineering product and so on.\nAnd then that is also the non-engineering product you know areas within the computer whether it is HR, finance, etc, to whatever things.\nSo where we are using tools is primarily around engineering and product like whether it is co-pilots for I take over looking at tools for automated testing when we are using generative AI.\nSo we have looked at various products in some cases it has worked well in one example could be GitHub co-pilot is as something that has worked well for us.\nWe have also looked at some other tools I am trying to remember it in lambda test and some others which have some generative AI capabilities for testing purposes.\nThey have been okay as in you know we have tried out a few things but the primary focus has been in writing core and test automation.\nThat is within the engineering organizations where I would say yeah we are okay. I would honestly say that the adoption is like great.\nWe had to push people to use the tools and and so on. Now, where we need to actually do a few more things is within the non-engineering organisations.\n\n@39:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have said of that, but I will come to this question, but if you don't specifically focusing on the technology side of things, you said GitHub Copilot was doing a big chunk of stuff, right?\nIn terms of this, I'll give you idea.\n\n@39:21 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nstarted with GitHub Copilot for just 20 user licenses, which is 10% of the engineering. And I thought I will learn a lot of licenses on day one.\nIt took me a month to use those 20 licenses because nobody was going to do this. And we had to come up with, we actually came up with an award, which was called an experimentation award, trying to push people to say, please use this, try it out.\nAnd I don't bring them because they were saying, yeah, we can use it, but I don't know how much value is provided, right?\nNow, in some cases, it's too dumb because it is not true. Because even for a developer, how much time to spend actual writing code, right?\n20%, 30%, because you're doing like code reviews, and you're doing a lot of other things. So, it took us time, but of all the tools, would say GitHub Copilot will be the most used and where we are using it is some code, some understanding of the code, some comments and some tests.\nAnd GitHub Copilot is not used for testing it something else, but I think that's where we are using it.\nIf I'm looking at, did it improve my productivity by say 15 percent? The easy way of measuring 15 percent is if I have a 200 people team, did I now get a value of 30 additional people, to be honest, I don't think so.\nOkay, so that's, part of it cannot be, it may not be the tool, part of it could be us, but that's for me is an easy way of looking at it as in, if my 200 people team is saying, oh, I need 10 more people, my, if I go to them and say, oh, that's just what, 5 percent?\nACTION ITEM: Consider implementing a 'generative AI KPI' to track code written by generative AI tools - WATCH\nCan you not be 5 percent more productive using these tools? I'm not sure that that's right. Okay.\n\n@40:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut it's difficult to measure it. So in terms of, let's. If you have to put a number to it, let us understand it's difficult to measure it.\nBut if you have to put a number to it, you would say, in your personal opinion, that GitHub co-pilot made a 15% difference to my team, 10% difference to my team, based on your view of it.\n\n@41:16 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI would say 10%. 10%. And that's point. It is all over. We are averaging out. Some people may have done a lot.\nSome people have done it. But I'm just saying, I don't think it's more than 10%.\n\n@41:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd that is very consistent with other companies of your scale that I've been with. And they also say the same thing.\naround 10%. It can be more.\n\n@41:36 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSomething that we are not doing well. I feel it can be done.\n\n@41:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSee, this is what everybody is experimenting with it. Even I think GitHub co-pilot team themselves do not know exactly how much it can extract out right now.\nAnd then there are other tools, Qasariya and others. So GitHub co-pilot still doesn't do the entire report scanning and then pulling out of it.\n\n@41:56 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nBut they do, right?\n\n@41:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd those things are very easy problems. Make a difference.\n\n@41:59 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nBut where?\n\n@42:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat?\n\n@42:00 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThe problem is you want to be sure that the vendor you are using, trust the vendor. What they are doing with the code, how are they actively responsible in terms of your data?\nAre they using it for training purposes? That's where it becomes a different problem. Absolutely. can go and willingly use any tool because it looks concrete.\n\n@42:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGet up, you don't mind because you already there. I already have a new tool.\n\n@42:21 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYou also looked at code here, for example, right? But again, you run into it. Are they a stable enough company?\nDo they have the right measures in place? Because the assumption is the data is going to be used.\n\n@42:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEverybody is worried about that piece of it. Great. this is good. I'm going to move down in terms of people.\nHR, or we would say, has there been any usage? Because you yourself are a HR based software. we dog feeding it?\nIs it helping out?\n\n@42:54 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nBecause of what I have noticed is outside technology. I was outside engineering. There are some people who are very extensive users of generative, and what I mean by extensive general, actually having a paid license, know, we had to actually roll out proper measures saying, you know, you don't put any company data into, you know, a chat GPT or anything if you're using it, you know, what others the right way.\nSo we actually went through all the whole effort. I would say some people extensively use it, especially some senior people, okay.\nEverything, including like even responding to an email device user, okay. So I've seen that as a responding to email, you know, getting, you know, the presentation ready for all hands, like I'm talking about senior people, you know, great, which is great, right, doesn't we use it, but not everybody use it, it's seen like marketing content, you know, give me the latest for, you know, I want to write an email for something, people extensively use it, like I use it,\nAnd then in terms of just default work, can I know that the younger folks like my daughter is going to go to college now, she does use generative AI now in terms of trying things out and so on.\n\n@44:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, and that's that's something which is which is probably my next I mean in terms of culture, what kind of culture are we trying to push forward and it's like, hey, you should go ahead and use generative AI or hey, you're not using generative AI, you will you will have to use generative AI or since it's not being used, I'm incentivizing it as you said earlier.\nRight. What is what is what is it that you feel in terms of culture as an organization in terms of genii that simplifies to drive this.\n\n@44:39 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nCorrect. So the first piece in terms of the culture was trying to communicate what is the best way of using it with some examples and then incentivizing especially the you know engineers and so on to use it.\nNow, when I say use it doesn't mean go to chat GPT and get chat GPT to drive code for it.\nBut when I say incentivize. is in what are the use cases you could automate? How can you do it better?\nWhat are the experiments you can do better by doing that? So, for example, one of the experiments that we want to do and really want to spend time on is you generate AI to create synthetic data for testing purposes because that's always a big problem, right?\nAs in, how do you get actual data to do it? Now, can you use gen AI to create synthetic data that I could use for testing purposes?\nSo, for me, it is more about and I'm specifically talking about engineering and so on. It is more about, so anyway, I'm going to change the world.\nWe are in the early stage of it. Better start figuring out how we can leverage it to make our lights more productive right now and be good at it, otherwise somebody else is going to do it.\n\n@45:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely, I agreed on that. And this is something that I say, I mean, when people ask me, Generally, AI is going to take over all jobs.\nsaid, no, Generally, AI is not going to take any job. It's the people who know Generally we will take your job.\n\n@46:01 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nExactly, exactly.\n\n@46:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so this is fine. We are basically moving on towards the communication and incentivizing phase, but there's a catch to it.\nWhen you say communicate with best examples, it means somebody has to either try it out one aspect of it.\nAll the second aspect is I figure out the leaders in my who are trying it out and I incentivize them the hey, you take it, figure out a good use case and then pass it on to the rest of the organization and work on it.\n\n@46:33 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo you are forcing anybody to try it out number one, just to be very clear. We may be nudging people to try it out, but not forcing anybody.\nBut there are always these folks who are always at the leading edge of it, who always want to try every new tool and so on.\nSo you work with them, you see if they have some good use cases, good experiments they are doing. So for example, we have a channel, Slack channel called show and tell heaven.\nWe also have a quarterly award for experimentation. So this, this, time we didn't even give an amount of our experimentation because we didn't see anything that was good enough.\nSo we thought that would be a good way to show hey, we need you to push more. We have also been internally brainstorming about and hackathon that is only an AI specific hackathon.\nSo everything in that hackathon that you build should be based on generative AI. Try it out, see what it is.\nSo these are different ways we are trying to do it. Should we have more adoption? Yes. But at least our culture is not to force anybody to do it.\nWait, does that work? Right.\n\n@47:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo in the culture, I mean, is it something that you are looking at, hey, I mean, these people are doing good, they should promote air when you go and you should actually first test out the use keys and then share it out with everybody and that's probably the award for experiment and the first way they like to do That's the way to do it.\n\n@47:50 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nare some people who are doing good, make them more visible, show the use cases, show how they are more productive or, you know, save time or, you know, that was high otherwise.\nand then encourage our incentivize others to do this.\n\n@48:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, and in this case, there have been some processes that would have had to change. For example, on two side of things.\nOne is the permissive side of things or nudging side of things. And the other is towards the blocking side of things and stopping end of the day.\nStop doing this.\n\n@48:18 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nFor example, on the blocking side, we did not want people to just go out and try every possible tool and do whatever they wanted to do.\nBecause we are a company that has been a pretty sensitive data financial. So we very explicitly created a small group, said, okay, you want to try a tool, send a note to this group, let them take a quick look at it.\nThis included our CISO, of our security team members. And if they saw a company that was like, you know, just total startup, no, SOC 2, did not have clarity on how they're going to use the data, we would tell them, yeah, the tool may look very good, but it's not allowed.\nOn the other hand, if you follow these five, six different guidelines, so we actually publish company with guidelines. If follow this guidelines and follow this process, we'll be very quick, we'll come back to you and we'll tell you, go ahead and try other things.\nBut it is not free for all. It's not incentivized, it doesn't go ahead and try anything and everything possible and if it works great.\nBecause we don't want to, at the end of it, the actual, you know, how the data is used and whether it is secure is very important.\n\n@49:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe'll come to the data part also because that's another interesting section of things. But in terms of processes, right?\nAgain, there's two sides of things. Blocking is what we are talking about. In terms of blocking, mean, are there some processes that we have put in place?\nAre they like, hey?\n\n@49:39 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThere are no formal processes. There are more of guidelines. Now, do I have anything that would prevent somebody from downloading a total random tool and using it to write code?\nSo there is a, it's more of guidelines and trust. And load tool will be purchased till it goes through it.\nNow, if somebody wants to use their credit card for them to write their JavaScript code, it. I have\n\n@50:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nin terms of pushing process again, I have heard that we have like the hackathon, the award and etcetera, are there any process, a specific HR process or business process that is in putting place to move these things around per se?\n\n@50:19 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWe have not, as in when you say process right, usually think top down, here is the process that everybody needs to follow.\nWe have not a very much a that much of a top down company, we are a lot more bottles of company.\nEven in terms of writing code and everything like we do pods and stuff, we have this whole thing about what empowerment, what that means is the pod needs to decide what they will deliver.\nNow, there will always be things that will be decided at company level, but generally it is the pod needs to decide.\n\n@50:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, but even at the pod level, will as a CTO will have some constriction like, hey, you should have a test coverage, right?\n\n@50:53 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nshould have, which are of process. us that for a. Okay. If there is no such thing as 20% of everything you do should be using Genia.\nis no such process.\n\n@51:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHave you seen that with other companies? Where people have put this form of business? They have been forced I mean to the level some companies and I will not name them because of whatever but some companies have forced people that you have to spend one day we are doing no work only figuring out how you can do your work better using Genia.\nThat has been the level that is the pinnacle of what I have heard.\n\n@51:34 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAnd has that been successful? Has that been successful?\n\n@51:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI would not call it successful because there no way of making it.\n\n@51:45 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYeah if I was a developer we bought it meant to be like I have four days of work and one days of doing whatever I want to do.\n\n@51:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah and end of the day I mean that was when about the company I was talking about I had been stopped and then regular things\nmoved on from there, but I did not see or the person was not able to clarify to me that was there any ten people benefits to it?\n\n@52:07 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI don't know how to measure it, that's the challenge, right? Like if there is a team, let's say 20 people, they come to me and say, I need two more people to finish this process.\nI can always tell them, can you figure out a way to be 10% more productive and do that? But it's very difficult to do that, and then it's very very difficult to measure it and say, okay, you are telling me to use a tool so that I can, I know I need two more people.\nIt's very difficult.\n\n@52:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's very difficult. It's but I mean, I was fortunate to be working with ASW capitals for around six, six and a half years, and the good thing about them is that they are 100% remote.\nThe good thing about being 100% remote is that you tend to measure what you are doing, because you are remote, being in front of me is like I'm doing things and blah, blah, blah, blah, So there was a way of measuring this out, maybe we can talk much more in detail about it.\n\n@52:59 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYeah, we can talk about it later.\n\n@53:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah. So the idea was to and it's a very quick way is divide down your work and say hey I spent 10% of my time doing this 10% of my time doing this 5% here have a work chart and then see what did what did what was actually cut out of that work chart that was the way that we some let's say specific guidelines for example as I said in terms of coding you might have some KPI is driving the process because you say hey I'm not giving you a process but I'm giving you KPI in essence that API will drive process right in some way things like code automation and quality and so on but it doesn't necessarily drive this KPI is not a gen AI KPI I don't have a gen AI\n\n@54:00 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAnd this is a good thing, maybe I should go back and think about the JNIK API, is in so many lines of code, maybe you can start very simple in terms of all the comments were written by JNI, but we don't have a JNIK API.\n\n@54:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, and this was like, I mean, these are some insights that came across from different leaders like yourself. as we do this discussion, lot of ideas come in, that's the nature of it.\nThe next section is about data as in, how are we making sure that we are able to manage our, and you're this very sensitive data, right?\nAI data in others, and you said about CD leadership trying to copy and put things in the mail and say, is this mail good?\nBut in the process, they're also putting in very sensitive information into the chatbot and pushing it.\n\n@54:49 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo that was my guidelines, now I'll talk about a larger data, because how our product works with the data.\nBecause that's where PII comes into play, right? So we have been very clear. in terms of the way we have built our gen AI tools, none of that data is sent to a third party vendor.\nAnd in the contract with the third party, none of that data can be used for training purposes. Now we also have a very specific contract with customers on whether or not we can use their data for testing purposes as well as we build our product.\nSome customers say yes, they are okay with it. Some customers will explicitly say no, okay, they can't use it.\nSo we have very formal processes built in place. We are also a member of an institute called responsible AI institute, which has very clear guidelines how we use data and so on.\nSo this comes up all the time, but the key is one, the data will not be used for training purposes.\nTwo, if we have to use it for testing purposes, it will be after your permission. And three, we also are working with certain vendors now on\nmasking the information. So, certain information will be totally masked. So, it doesn't matter, right, as in you can use it.\nSo, that's the third piece. But for us, that is very important. Because otherwise, customers will not share it. And it becomes very important as you even go to, like, areas like Europe, where we already do a residency and all that.\nAnd they have a lot more strict reviews.\n\n@56:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd others will follow suit too.\n\n@56:25 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nOne other thing that we also do, because we do things like sentiment checks, etc. within the system, that data when we show our manager saying, Hey, this is what's happening in your group.\nWe keep it at a level where you cannot go in and drill down to an individual employee. Because it cannot be used to, you know, as in if you see a sentiment in my group is bad.\nAnd the reason was for that is XYZ, the manager cannot do that and go to XYZ. So, you are the cost for it.\nI'm going to find it. So, we have a lot of those built-in terms of data.\n\n@57:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd this was on the side of product, what about the side of regular usage, mean, it's really hard to control and understand, even balance it out in any way, I mean, are there some guidelines, messages, push that we have a all three during place?\n\n@57:17 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo we have regular, so we be part of guidelines, these are read only articles that people have to under, just like you do a security or harassment thing kind of, right?\nThis is how you use it. But I also know companies that will actually block IP addresses or say, we don't do any of that, because either way, this person will go home and, you know, do whatever they want to do, right?\nAnd we do use IT tools in terms of what's downloaded, what's tracked, every PC has that as in, we don't want a sales guy leaving the company to just suddenly download all the customer information and then take it with them, right?\nSo there are tools available to do that. But I think level seven and things like that, but in terms of genia, it is more of a here's\npolicy here is what you are supposed to do, but there is nothing that prevents a person from going to a chat security or a cloud or something.\n\n@58:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nUnderstand. That makes sense. And that is very similar to how most Silicon Valley companies are.\n\n@58:14 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nIt is looking like tend to allow people that do you do what you want to do, right?\n\n@58:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, and with specifically the remote working culture that has obtained, mean a lot of things have become a more liberal in those cases.\nBut they are still companies doing that. Just for this, let's say coffee, last part of this section is the operation piece of it.\nWhat are we? operations is hefty, right? When you are so many things in terms of operations moving, are they putting something in terms of operations on getting it.\n\n@58:56 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nLike what is it? Let me say putting operations.\n\n@59:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, we have a lot of coverage in terms of whether operationally we are efficient or not. Let's say just measuring our way that we have this amount of resource being spent for this amount of time.\n\n@59:15 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nmuch money we are spending are we operational? Okay.\n\n@59:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@59:19 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nwe track that very, very regularly, isn't it also is where we are spending money. So I'll give you an example.\nFor example, on our search, we literally in some cases are using a 3.5, some cases we are using a four in certain areas, we are looking at using a llama.\nSo we are actually looking at cost effective way operationally, what is the amount of data we should pass. You know, do we need to use some open source versus this?\nthose are the things because this goes out of hand very quickly in terms of that something that we track, but it is not just a geni item, geni is yes, because the cost can really go out.\nBut either way, if you are a public cloud user, you really need to be. on top of it because other you will be spending tens of billions of dollars on hosting, right?\nRight.\n\n@1:00:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nis operational with respect to technical way you are trying to measure time cost etc. But then there again operation in terms of let's say ticket management like you said, right?\nThat's operations being managed in in a small slot by AI, right? But then there are other operations like maybe you are having logistics in the company where you are trying to see maybe inclusion, inclusion is one of the very...\n\n@1:00:26 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nbecause we are a pure software SaaS company. So in that sense, managing operations using Jenny and not happening. Okay.\n\n@1:00:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. a lot of companies are using it for tracking inclusion in the company whether people are being included or not and those things across as well.\nHow will you measure that?\n\n@1:00:42 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThat's a very curious thing.\n\n@1:00:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFor example, if you look at Jives, right? Jive has a measurement of, I mean, Parak talks to Vicky and Parak talks to the company, he doesn't talk to Mr.\nX, who is probably generally out in... Africa and I get a tendency over the last three months to only talk to people and not include experts or not include women.\nI mean, and those those are the metrics we are being tracked and you don't do that.\n\n@1:01:11 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI actually don't even know whether it is that because now you are literally spying on people in terms of that.\n\n@1:01:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd but that's what inclusion is all about. It's about spying otherwise you will never know who was included and who's not included.\n\n@1:01:23 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThere's no way. We don't do that. I think it very useful is the positive use case of it to say here's the network of people who are important who contribute a lot.\nSo if you are like onboarding a new user to say, Oh, if you go to these three people, they are extremely active.\nThey may help you on board faster. I also want to talk about positive use case and inclusion use case.\nWe don't do it.\n\n@1:01:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah. So that's also one of the inclusion is also taken positively for us in promote more inclusion. And this is great.\nNetwork importance is one. The other is finding out the influencers because there are certain people.\n\n@1:01:56 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWhat is there? mean, that's one of the influencers.\n\n@1:01:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's what I'm saying. So.\n\n@1:02:00 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nYeah, that is something that we have actually played around within our product a lot, right? example, you know, you could very easily create influencer maps using like graph right or something like that, right?\nBut that is something that's in the product, but in terms of DEI inclusion, we don't do that. I would not even do that.\nI think some of it is a different time for some of it is I'm not even sure I believe it.\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n@1:02:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's organization specific at all. Now, on to the strategic goals further and I know we have reached time. Is it open to continue for a few more minutes?\nYeah, few more minutes. Yeah. So in terms of strategic goals, right now, and for this purpose, for this purpose we will assume everything is funky to me, right?\nWhen Genia is giving me what it has promised, everything is good, mean, the cows are flying in the air and everything is happening now.\nWhat exactly are we looking at as a? This is something it can do for me, and it will help my strategy goal of my organization do it better.\n\n@1:03:08 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nOh, there is lots of things we could do, right? Everything is hunky-dory, everything from resource management in terms of, you know, who is working on what are we actually using time well to off-skilling and training.\nThat is another piece that I can really see Jenai help us, right? Can I truly use some of these poor pilots to do real-time off-skilling and training of employees, right?\nWe want to learn a new skill that can actually be done real-time, right? With some of these tools, ultimately it's about content creation and using things that are already done.\nAnd I'm talking about strategic vision in terms of, you know, trying to automate as many use cases as possible, right?\nbasic project management. There's tons of things that you could do as a part of project management using JNI where you could auto get things like a lot of things at a TPM, so technical program manager, can you auto manage JNI?\n\n@1:04:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe don't have to wait for that, right?\n\n@1:04:16 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAnd I'm not talking about technology, so I could just like use cases with you, where you could try it.\nIt is just you have to go through it, try it out and see. And in some cases, JNI may be even useful to it.\n\n@1:04:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it has to affect your strategy goal. One of the strategy goal is I want to be better more productive.\nyeah, resource management is one. What other strategy goals you think will be affected?\n\n@1:04:41 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nIt's about being much more productive overall internally. And two is making our employees a lot more productive, because ultimately it's about making life easy for employees, right?\nThat is a strategic goal of the company. We want to make life easier for employees. There are lots of things that we could do.\nNow, by the way, usage of J&A, the focus is more external than internal. How can we make our product size that we can make employees like easy?\nNow, we use the same product too, so in a way, we are indirectly impacting us. But that would be just strategic work.\n\n@1:05:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOK, that makes sense. Great data answers. The last part of this is the second last part, sorry. I mean, any particular achieve, excuse me.\nAny particular achievement that you think that you can highlight, say, this was the biggest game changers so far, that I would say, hands down, this has been the biggest benefit so far of J&A to me, of the organizations in class.\n\n@1:05:44 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nIt's tough to say biggest game changer, because biggest game changer, as in, you really move the needle, right? You really move the needle.\nI would say, actually, there are multiple projects that are going on that could be game changers. But I don't think we are there, where I can say, hey, we have, we have gained victory.\nmultiple areas that we are doing, when it is creating of content, whether it is automating workflows, use cases. But like I said, I don't think we are there yet in terms of calling out the victory.\nMany of these things are in the early series, as in I don't think it's done enough.\n\n@1:06:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in between these, what would you say is relatively the highest in payment?\n\n@1:06:24 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAnd I think where we have done a lot of work is around searching for information. I think that is where I would say we have made good progress.\nAnd when I say progress has been made in multiple areas, but what would give the maximum ROI to the customer?\nSearch. Because that is something I hear all the time from CIS. Find a way to better automate my task and find a way to better search for information.\nAnd when I say search, it gives me specific answer, right, to my question.\n\n@1:06:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. Perfect. answer. I mean, I'm coming to the last section. because basically hindsight and these are more of your thoughts in terms of quick certain questions which will like be more about not specific to simpler but also simpler and then the state percent.\nWhat is the hardest hurdle in implementing JANAI for you so far? Expectation management.\n\n@1:07:21 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nVery good. I can immediately tell you what people think JANAI can do versus what JANAI can actually do.\n\n@1:07:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nis a big deal.\n\n@1:07:32 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI was waiting for that.\n\n@1:07:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat is the overall most notable success while implementing JANAI solutions? You say that, hey, it's able to do this great or this great so far from what you have seen.\n\n@1:07:48 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nAs I'm specific to my team, I think JANAI is doing a decent job on the development side of the house as I'm coding and commenting, understanding,\ncold that is where I would say is one good achievement also in terms of content creation I would say that is the most mature use case because that has been one of the earliest things Jenny I was doing right so that another piece that there and when I say content creation it could be text it could be video it could be all kinds of content right but that those are like some of the more you know mature use cases what I call it and then put that reminds you by that forgotten one piece and that is we did not talk about the marketing sales side of things which which other organizations have been extensively using gen AI in so we are using gen AI in marketing lot I don't think we are using it in sales okay and marketing basically for content creation and content creation coming up with you know campaigns coming up with how brand can be used getting data\nfor that all of them. So, marketing we do use Genia quite a bit.\n\n@1:09:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat, I just remembered that, sorry. Coming back to it, what has been your biggest revelation if you must have come back, I understand in a nutshell that this was the biggest revelation that I had using Genia so far.\n\n@1:09:20 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nI think a couple of things I mentioned, one is the way where we are in terms of Genia, very easy to get started, anybody can get started, going from 0 to 1 is super easy but then building on top of that and being you know 1 to x stuff or 1 to n stuff, that's number one.\nNumber two, the so called naysayers who think Genia is going to replace all of us and on so on, we are far away from that.\nThe best that the best use cases are where you are going to leverage Genia as a tool in your toolbox that's just going to make your life easier.\neasier to do better things. Now not everybody will use it that way but this is just going to spawn a whole new industry of jobs and you know things to do better just like others have I think the only difference is the earlier paradigm shifts were taking longer time this is going to take a much shorter time but we don't know today what are all the things that are going to happen in three to five years like last year a prompt engineer was a great role nobody knew that is a prompt engineer.\nI don't think that role is going to exist in a couple of years as a prompt engineer.\n\n@1:10:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean everybody will come up with your own and I made this comment way back on Twitter that hey prompt engineering is going to be automated I mean it knows how to get that done right you just have to say like that was a brand new role people are getting a lot of money for next month.\nIf you have a chance to turn back in here, what would you have been doing differently in this year?\nLet's say you turn back in here right now with your current knowledge.\n\n@1:11:09 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWhat will you have done? have turned around with using geni-act quite a bit in terms of learning and so on.\nof it was because of the advances made. If I had to turn back in here, I think I would actually put a lot more structured approach to how we go about using some of these capabilities, create a team and things.\nSo we are a lot more structured in terms of how we would have rolled it out and how we would have done it, how we would have focused on it compared to what we did.\nthink we kind of struggled around with it.\n\n@1:11:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's fair. And again, I know the answer for this but just for the sake of the question. What is your opinion on geni-act being super helpful, not helpful, helpful?\nToday or overall?\n\n@1:11:57 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nSo you started with variate. like on a scale of one to five red, five was to first go on scale of one to five.\nI think today we are under two, but I think two will become a three, four very soon.\n\n@1:12:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat. And the last question for this is, what is your recommendation for companies who are looking to achieve digital transformation through generative AI?\n\n@1:12:20 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nWhat is your suggestion? A lot of experimentation see what works for you, and then based on what works implement that don't just believe, go based on the hype, but do a lot of experimentation, because it's not a one-size-fits-all.\n\n@1:12:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think your last statement is the highlight that we have one-size-fits-all.\n\n@1:12:43 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nIt's not plug and play, right? There's a lot of work that has to go into making it work.\n\n@1:12:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely. And I mean, in my experience, even if you have to make a simple rag tool, or a question-answer board for different data sets, it's different.\nYou cannot have the same rag tool or a question-answer set for all the data sets. It has to be different.\n\n@1:13:02 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThis has been great parag.\n\n@1:13:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you so much. I cannot thank you enough for your time because I know the amount you are measuring.\nThere are a lot of things that you are doing. No, no, I appreciate it.\n\n@1:13:14 - Parag Kulkarni (Simpplr)\nThis kind of switching back, it just maybe should be a not tomorrow in terms of what we discussed. And then I will see what I can do and I will have some internal discussions on myself.\nAbsolutely.

        "content": "Alright, I switched on the recording for this one.\n0:00:00 – 0:00:04\n\nSo, to understand our industry or sector, which I understand, basically we are into system integration, right?\n0:00:04 – 0:00:14\n\nAnd system integration into the government sector and into the private sector and mostly within India and not out. Is that right?\n0:00:14 – 0:00:24\n\nSo, largely we are focusing on the government vertical and the defence vertical.\n0:00:24 – 0:00:28\n\nOkay.\n0:00:28 – 0:00:30\n\nAnd doing large turnkey projects around these particular verticals around four technologies, which is networking, data centers, wireless technologies and the IT security.\n0:00:30 – 0:00:40\n\nSo, that is what we focus on.\n0:00:40 – 0:00:42\n\nOkay.\n0:00:42 – 0:00:43\n\nYeah.\n0:00:43 – 0:00:44\n\nPerfect.\n0:00:44 – 0:00:46\n\nSo, with all this that is going on, what is the rough, I would say, company size in terms of turnover and in terms of human resource that we have?\n0:00:46 – 0:00:58\n\nSo, our revenues are close to 500 crores last year and our manpower is close to 700 people who work for us across various kinds of technologies.\n0:00:58 – 0:01:08\n\nBut largely these are the technical guys.\n0:01:08 – 0:01:10\n\nAnd the geography is India basically, right?\n0:01:10 – 0:01:12\n\nGeography is India, yeah.\n0:01:12 – 0:01:14\n\nOkay.\n0:01:14 – 0:01:16\n\nAll right.\n0:01:16 – 0:01:17\n\nNow, in terms of AI adoption, right?\n0:01:17 – 0:01:21\n\nSo, AI adoption, I will try and put forward a few ways.\n0:01:21 – 0:01:28\n\nSo, one is that we are putting it in our products and putting it externally in front of customers or our stakeholders and others, right?\n0:01:28 – 0:01:38\n\nWe have external facing actions. One is our internal facing actions where we are trying to optimize our workflow, getting our operations done better, faster, right?\n0:01:38 – 0:01:50\n\nSo, we will take these as two separate things, the internal side and the external side.\n0:01:50 – 0:01:54\n\nSo, if we talk about the internal side, I mean, do you think that AI adoption has been done to some extent?\n0:01:54 – 0:02:00\n\nTo what extent are we looking at it right now?\n0:02:00 – 0:02:04\n\nTo be very frank, in terms of the internal processes, largely it is more to do with automation and sort of using some sort of BI tools rather than actual AI tools.\n0:02:04 – 0:02:16\n\nIn terms of automation, if I see various functions within the organization, starting from let's say HR or maybe finance or maybe SCM or maybe the project delivery or those kind of MIS reporting functions.\n0:02:16 – 0:02:30\n\nSo, there are a lot of tools which have been deployed around automation.\n0:02:30 – 0:02:34\n\nLet me start with let's say HR itself.\n0:02:34 – 0:02:36\n\nStarting from capturing the renders which used to happen traditionally by capturing the registers which has moved to the biometrics, biometrics to GPS locations on the mobile itself.\n0:02:36 – 0:02:48\n\nPeople coming in the vicinity, they can just click on the mobile itself and everything gets automated.\n0:02:48 – 0:02:52\n\nTheir movement or in terms of the reimbursement. So, if you are moving from one place to another place, you just straight away click the start location and where you have reached, automatically kilometers will get calculated and it will get put into the claim report itself.\n0:02:52 – 0:03:08\n\nSo, that helps in terms of automation. I won't say that really it's an artificial intelligence, but yes, there are a lot of automation tools which have been deployed across various verticals.\n0:03:08 – 0:03:18\n\nNow, how they integrate between themselves, that's a different thing that HR getting integrated with finance that once the bills have been or the I would say claims have been put in how it goes to finance for the reimbursement.\n0:03:18 – 0:03:30\n\nSo, those kind of integration between various kind of apps are there. There are certain tools and there are certain isolated tools depending on the requirements.\n0:03:30 – 0:03:36\n\nI would say in terms of MIS where there is a lot of data analysis which happens across various projects or across various employees what they are doing.\n0:03:36 – 0:03:46\n\nStarting from various kind of automated tools, it starts from basic Excel itself. Now, Excel is also upgraded to a large extent with various kind of automation and I would say analysis which can be done based on those tools itself.\n0:03:46 – 0:03:58\n\nIt becomes easier to manage the data and it can handle up to a limited aspect, but then there are various kind of MIS tools where you keep on punching in, where you keep on capturing it from various kind of fields.\n0:03:58 – 0:04:10\n\nAnd since we are working on the project which is vast customer base and there are more than few hundreds deployments which happens on a daily basis. So, what is the progress? Everything has to be monitored.\n0:04:10 – 0:04:20\n\nSo, in terms of MIS itself, there are some 6 to 8 resources who just work on capturing these kind of data, analyzing and presenting it to various teams to see where we stand on the ground.\n0:04:20 – 0:04:32\n\nSo, this is where I see internally that it is more to do with the automation than any kind of AI which is actually deployed in the organization.\n0:04:32 – 0:04:42\n\nOkay. So, I will come to some other aspects as well. A lot of companies that I have talked to, these people have said, we have been recently using generative AI to draft our emails or big contracts that have been put forward.\n0:04:42 – 0:05:04\n\nSo, it becomes easy. We have put it in Chachi APT, copy paste it, changed it a bit, iterated it a couple of times and we save our time. The marketing departments are gung-ho that we are saving around 50% of our effort and money.\n0:05:04 – 0:05:18\n\nBecause I get images, I am able to cut down the content writers time because businesses require content writing, they require getting out marketing.\n0:05:18 – 0:05:28\n\nThere are a lot of different things, contract writing, proposal writing, etc. So, they are saving a ton of time and money in at least these aspects.\n0:05:28 – 0:05:40\n\nSo, have we tried out things on these aspects or no? For us right now, it is not the right time to try out on these aspects.\n0:05:40 – 0:05:46\n\nTo be very frank, the kind of the things that you mentioned about the product, about drafting the contract. So, since we are working on the large contracts with the government, so yes, there are in-house legal guys and there are also agencies who work for us.\n0:05:46 – 0:06:02\n\nAnd I am sure they will be using these kinds of tools internally to create those kinds of things. And in terms of capturing all the final aspects and then collating that particular thing.\n0:06:02 – 0:06:12\n\nBut once it comes to us, I would say our team has to go through each and everything in terms of validating because every contract, every clause may impact in a huge aspect.\n0:06:12 – 0:06:26\n\nSo, yes, there are tools which are used in the backend. But if I say that it is more than 50% of the automation, I won't say it will be more than 10-15% at this point in time.\n0:06:26 – 0:06:36\n\nAnd this will be more helpful for the organizations where there is lot of, I would say consumer interaction. Whether it is the bank, whether it is the product.\n0:06:36 – 0:06:44\n\nAs much as B2C.\n0:06:44 – 0:06:44\n\nB2C, so B2C. And since we are largely B2G and the government itself is very, I would say, skeptical in terms of absorbing the new technologies till the time it is proven.\n0:06:44 – 0:06:58\n\nRight.\n0:06:58 – 0:07:00\n\nThey have their own paraphernalia and the legal liabilities associated with what they are doing. And for them it is not, it is B2C but that is not consumer, that is citizen.\n0:07:00 – 0:07:10\n\nAnd all those particular things, whatever they are doing right, wrong, which gets false under RTI and then anyone can go to the court challenging any kind of data which is given by the government.\n0:07:10 – 0:07:20\n\nSo I think government has also moved a step, whether we see various kinds of taxation departments, whether it is income tax, GST or various kinds of organizations which are citizen interactive like the PF department, the ESI department.\n0:07:20 – 0:07:34\n\nThey are using a lot of business intelligence tools or the statistical analysis tools so as to capture what is happening, how it is happening, what needs to be fixed.\n0:07:34 – 0:07:44\n\nSo as to create the policies and addressing those particular challenges which are faced by the citizens.\n0:07:44 – 0:07:50\n\nMay not be to the extent of AI. So AI, largely I see the application traditionally starting almost around 10 years back with the, I would say the chatbots for the banks largely.\n0:07:50 – 0:08:00\n\nThere is a lot of interaction which is happening, a lot of queries which are coming which can just be fetched from the data which is there in their own system itself and then respond to the consumers.\n0:08:00 – 0:08:10\n\nSo there is a lot of automation which has happened around those particular things.\n0:08:10 – 0:08:14\n\nRight.\n0:08:14 – 0:08:14\n\nProduct companies who can create the video, the product designs, how it has to be presented, it had a lot of value.\n0:08:14 – 0:08:20\n\nSo I think these are some of the areas where the absorption is much higher than the segment that we address.\n0:08:20 – 0:08:26\n\nThere are two aspects of this technology that I see in the segment that you address.\n0:08:26 – 0:08:32\n\nSegment 1 is data understanding and collision. Right. Traditional AI is very limited in terms of being able to, which we say that whoever puts the horse on the ice, it will run straight.\n0:08:32 – 0:08:50\n\nBecause if we have trained him that there will be two boxes, then he will understand the two boxes and run like this.\n0:08:50 – 0:08:54\n\nThat's not how the real world works. Sometimes somebody can sign above the box, below the box, around the box. Right.\n0:08:54 – 0:09:00\n\nAnd gen AI, the AI that is now since the last two years promoting itself a lot, is able to work with that kind of content.\n0:09:00 – 0:09:08\n\nContent that is like somebody wrote a note.\n0:09:08 – 0:09:10\n\nNow you don't have any idea that what is written on the paper, is it positive or negative.\n0:09:10 – 0:09:14\n\nBecause first you have to understand it, then you have to categorize it, which becomes difficult.\n0:09:14 – 0:09:18\n\nBut with gen AI that is coming, these kind of things become a breeze.\n0:09:18 – 0:09:22\n\nAnd in your line of work and in the government sector of work, I see this as one of the major driving where it can be utilized a lot.\n0:09:22 – 0:09:30\n\nSo that's one part of it. Second part where I see it being used a lot is in terms of one hidden property that this has that it can now logicalize.\n0:09:30 – 0:09:42\n\nSo LLMs now have a power of basic logicalizing since the last around one and a half years and simple automations where traditional if else a number of cases are not known.\n0:09:42 – 0:09:58\n\nThere this kind of logicalization really helps because now I can't take out all the cases, right.\n0:09:58 – 0:10:04\n\nBut he can understand that if someone writes A, D, N instead of AND, so it can understand and can still take it and move forward with it.\n0:10:04 – 0:10:10\n\nSo these are the two use cases where I see this kind of stuff being helpful in the industry that you are saying.\n0:10:10 – 0:10:16\n\nIs there a need or not a need there any how for these two?\n0:10:16 – 0:10:22\n\nAs the technology keeps advancing, there are a lot of applications which can be found across various sectors.\n0:10:22 – 0:10:28\n\nAnd I'm sure government will also be able to find the utility around of these particular technologies in the domains that they are offering the services to the citizens.\n0:10:28 – 0:10:40\n\nAnd the number of citizens and consumers remains the same.\n0:10:40 – 0:10:44\n\nSo there are a lot of things and we have seen a lot of automation which has happened starting from the I would say the IT returns itself and the reforms which has reduced to two weeks.\n0:10:44 – 0:10:54\n\nThose kind of automations have already helped.\n0:10:54 – 0:10:56\n\nNow, yes, in terms of the AI, how much it is going to be helpful because government will still like to work on those particular please describe more or the philosophy that if this has to happen, then this is the action.\n0:10:56 – 0:11:08\n\nYes, at the back end, they may use these kind of technologies to analyze what other things can be done and then imbibing those particular thing as a part of the intelligence which they have built in their application.\n0:11:08 – 0:11:20\n\nSo use cases will be more at the back end in terms of analyzing the things rather than implementing on the fly.\n0:11:20 – 0:11:24\n\nRight. So what I understand internally, we are not using a lot except for 10 to 15 percent saving in terms of drafting, which is again not your part, but legal and outsourced.\n0:11:24 – 0:11:36\n\nRight. At that end, other than that, right now we are not using gen AI or image generation or anything of that sort.\n0:11:36 – 0:11:44\n\nHow about externally? I mean, is there something where we interface with like one of our products, right?\n0:11:44 – 0:11:50\n\nWhere we use it, for example, anomaly detection, right?\n0:11:50 – 0:11:54\n\nWe have now, I mean, with the new video tools which have come in, I can actually watch a camera and say, hey, if I see a gun immediately alarm me.\n0:11:54 – 0:12:02\n\nRight. And those sort, right? It can actually analyze the feed on its own and just by giving text commands, it can actually move across and do those things.\n0:12:02 – 0:12:12\n\nAre we trying to incorporate that in a product? Now, this is the external facing, not the internal side of things.\n0:12:12 – 0:12:16\n\nSo I'll come to what you're referring in terms of the camera or analyzing these kind of guns.\n0:12:16 – 0:12:22\n\nSo we are right now implementing one of the projects for Delhi Police, which is for Delhi Safety, which is replying 10,000 cameras for women safety across all the traffic junctions.\n0:12:22 – 0:12:32\n\nNow, these particular cameras are going to capture certain use cases which are already defined.\n0:12:32 – 0:12:38\n\nLet's say if they see a gun or if they see someone falling or someone running at a very fast speed or there are more than let's say X number of people in the vicinity which come together or a crowd gathering itself.\n0:12:38 – 0:12:50\n\nSo there are some sort of let's say 150 cases which are defined. As soon as any of these particular things happen, there is an alarm which gets generated.\n0:12:50 – 0:12:58\n\nNow, you may see this as an AI. I would see this as a part of the BI itself. These are predefined cases.\n0:12:58 – 0:13:04\n\nIt is not that the camera or the VMS software, which is the video management software is doing anything on the fly.\n0:13:04 – 0:13:10\n\nThese kind of cases have been predefined and have been implemented.\n0:13:10 – 0:13:14\n\nThey have been trained basically. The model has been trained to actually only detect that much.\n0:13:14 – 0:13:18\n\nYeah. So from an application perspective, these particular things have already been captured, imbibed and implemented, but in a well-structured fashion.\n0:13:18 – 0:13:28\n\nSo there is no new case or nothing which is unusual which happens which goes beyond 150 cases will generate an alarm.\n0:13:28 – 0:13:36\n\nEven that might be of a relevance, but then that particular relevance will get captured over a period of time and those new cases will happen and then it will become part of the new applications which get created on that.\n0:13:36 – 0:13:48\n\nRight. So you are depending on the OEM for these kind of things. You are not developing them on your side.\n0:13:48 – 0:13:54\n\nSo there are OEMs who work with us. So there are video analytics platforms. We take the products from them and then we customize those particular things as per the user requirement.\n0:13:54 – 0:14:02\n\nOkay. Understood. And I mean, you are running such a large organization. Do you feel that hey, there were certain places where I started using things like chat, GPT or I mean other tools and either they worked or they didn't work.\n0:14:02 – 0:14:30\n\nI mean, how did how did how was your experience with it?\n0:14:30 – 0:14:32\n\nI don't think we have at the organization level. The need has been felt because there are well-structured environments and I would say the approach towards these kind of large opportunities or in terms of capturing or bidding for that or even executing.\n0:14:32 – 0:14:52\n\nThose are the structured environments which are given. Yes, in terms of internal management of the people of the projects of the kind of the reporting which happen, there could be a limited scope which can be used.\n0:14:52 – 0:15:04\n\nBut yes, there are various kind of tools which are already available, which captures all the needs which are there for us and we get our tools customized based on our requirements.\n0:15:04 – 0:15:16\n\nUnderstood. How our workflow happens from let's say we get an order to the execution, to sourcing of the material, how the material has to reach, then which project guy has to be informed.\n0:15:16 – 0:15:26\n\nSo, entire automation process has been customized as per our requirement and those particular applications have been rolled out. So, each are customized as per our need.\n0:15:26 – 0:15:36\n\nOkay. Understood. So, let us say you get a magic wand, right? And the magic wand says, say, artificial intelligence does the job.\n0:15:36 – 0:15:50\n\nWhat are the strategic goals in the organization where you think, oh, I can half my manpower here or I can increase my time to delivery here or I can save cost.\n0:15:50 – 0:16:04\n\nRight. Or I can improve the quality. I mean, with what you have heard and what you imagine further, what do you think are the places or what are the specific business areas where you can have certain goals being really beneficial for the business and can really like save time, money, effort, quality.\n0:16:04 – 0:16:24\n\nYes. So, what is happening is that since we are addressing these kind of large customers on the infrastructure and we have to give very high uptime in terms of the SLAs, the service level, which have to be committed to the customers, let's say something going down, we have to get it fixed in two hours or four hours.\n0:16:24 – 0:16:42\n\nSo, getting the information in terms of what has gone wrong, getting the specific information becomes very important. I am telling you about this camera thing itself. There is a camera which is mounted, there is a pole, there is a cable which comes in, a network cable which goes to the switch there, there is a UPS, there is a battery, there is a power which comes in.\n0:16:42 – 0:17:02\n\nAny of these things going down, the camera will not function. Now, if there is an uptime, let's say four hours which has to be given, from the time the call is reported, you have to fix within four hours itself.\n0:17:02 – 0:17:14\n\nNow, before even reporting the call by the customer, I should know if something goes down, so there is automation that alarms should get generated.\n0:17:14 – 0:17:20\n\nAnd then there has to be, sometimes you are able to identify from the central side, we call it network operation center, that what has gone wrong, based on the alarm there are certain kind of SNMP tools which are available, which are the technical tools which let us know that what has gone wrong.\n0:17:20 – 0:17:34\n\nBut sometimes that information is not available, so we need to send an engineer to that particular location to find out.\n0:17:34 – 0:17:42\n\nNow, there is a cost and there is a time delay which impacts each and every call and when we are talking these are hundreds of calls which are happening every day.\n0:17:42 – 0:17:50\n\nThe kind of the resource movement is huge and the kind of the cost involved is limit.\n0:17:50 – 0:17:56\n\nSo, there are technologies like various kind of sensors, the IoT sensors which we call the Internet of Things.\n0:17:56 – 0:18:02\n\nThose are the kind of the tools which are getting deployed to identify to the next level that what is going wrong, so we specifically know before going there that what has gone wrong.\n0:18:02 – 0:18:12\n\nSo, the engineer if it is going, the number of calls it can be remotely managed, we fix it remotely.\n0:18:12 – 0:18:18\n\nIf the person has to go, he goes with the right kind of spheres and right kind of know-how and right kind of skill set.\n0:18:18 – 0:18:22\n\nSo, there will be different kind of people with different kind of skill set, so the person goes and fix the problem in no time.\n0:18:22 – 0:18:28\n\nSo, those are the kind of the intelligence which is going to be build up which the organizations are working on in terms of optimizing the SLAs and minimizing the movement of the people.\n0:18:28 – 0:18:40\n\nRight, makes sense.\n0:18:40 – 0:18:46\n\nSo, again these will be predefined sequences or the actions which those that sensor has to take, what the sensor has to capture and communicate and based on that particular information the people have to analyze that what is the problem.\n0:18:46 – 0:19:00\n\nAnd with this amount of skill that you are talking, if people don't analyze and there is some tool to analyze and give you the final result here, these are the things, these are the problems, these are the areas this person should be sent and sends a message to him as well go coordinate and finish it up that might be good in case.\n0:19:00 – 0:19:18\n\nBut I would say still it is not your gen AI, it is just one step before that.\n0:19:18 – 0:19:24\n\nI understand, I understand but with that it still makes a lot of difference because then it can analyze, it can figure out what are the problems where we can improve and we can fast pace things.\n0:19:24 – 0:19:36\n\nThat's a great use case, that's a great use case. What other use case you envision that will be a major game changer in terms of making things better or faster or cheaper.\n0:19:36 – 0:19:52\n\nLook, in terms of I would say the customer interfacing like the customer service calls, we were doing one particular project where there were more than 23 lakh users almost 2.3 million users which were using that particular infrastructure.\n0:19:52 – 0:20:04\n\nAnd so that was sort of a citizen services that we were offering on behalf of the government. So there were some calls which were coming in and there was a team which was deployed at the help desk to answer those particular things and these were certain sort of Wi-Fi services which were offered to the consumer.\n0:20:04 – 0:20:20\n\nAnd then what is the mobile they are using, what is the iOS level or the operating system level they are using, what is the search engine they are using, if they are facing those particular calls.\n0:20:20 – 0:20:32\n\nSo there was a team which used to work and offer the kind of solutions to them. So I think on these kind of service platforms, the help desk, I think there is a lot of potential of using these kind of technologies.\n0:20:32 – 0:20:44\n\nYeah, I totally agree because we have actually saved millions of dollars with L1 support. I mean L1 support is one thing that we have purely mitigated in some of the companies where I mean at least a monthly million, few million dollar savings are like easy for us, straightforward.\n0:20:44 – 0:21:06\n\nSo that even I mean I was having a call with these people with some media companies basically brands, one of the major brand magazine owners in the world and then one of the media companies which handles events etc.\n0:21:06 – 0:21:22\n\nAnd they were also of the opinion that hey I mean this kind of thing really matters when we are trying to reach out and do a conversation as well because now they are actually using AI based callers.\n0:21:22 – 0:21:40\n\nSo first level of calling the cold callings they are actually pushing to automated AI callers which I mean are still under experimentation but I mean that's going to save them humongous amounts of money because it can make 10,000 calls in around 10 minutes.\n0:21:40 – 0:21:56\n\nSo I mean that's a no brainer right. So those are also coming not there yet but in a very very short amount of time those will also be here. Great that's awesome.\n0:21:56 – 0:22:08\n\nIn terms of let's break down our things a bit so there is technology, there is people, there is data right.\n0:22:08 – 0:22:18\n\nIn terms of technology I understand that we are more of integration and delivery people so our external work totally depends on the orders which have come in.\n0:22:18 – 0:22:30\n\nAnd I mean if the order is not specifically looking for JNAI and since the specifications are so stringent we have to follow those and there is no scope of wiggling around there.\n0:22:30 – 0:22:40\n\nInternally so far we have not explored on what JNAI can do and give benefits in accordance additional to what we already have because we already have tools which are doing a lot of automation and other stuff.\n0:22:40 – 0:22:54\n\nSo that's the technology side of things but inside of I mean towards the people side of things right.\n0:22:54 – 0:23:02\n\nI mean do you encourage people to go figure out something is coming or not in JNAI or AI and I mean I am going to incentivize you if you are doing something like this so people side of things right.\n0:23:02 – 0:23:14\n\nYou know so people side of things now and since we are a technical organization and almost 85% of people are technical guys so there is a minimum training requirement which is defined by the HR itself that every technical guy has to go through minimum 9 mandates of the training every year.\n0:23:14 – 0:23:32\n\nAnd in the technology areas that they are working or they would like to skill themselves up.\n0:23:32 – 0:23:38\n\nTo be very frank I see a lot of training of gradation which is happening a lot of skill of gradation and we take the requirements from the individuals as well as their supervisors because it has to be relevant to the kind of the work that they are doing.\n0:23:38 – 0:23:52\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:23:52 – 0:23:54\n\nAnd I think till today I have not seen anyone asking for the training on JNAI.\n0:23:54 – 0:24:00\n\nYes there are it is more related to the kind of the technology they are doing or the advanced technologies they would like to move on to but since the kind of the area that we are working our consumers or the people in our segment or even our competition.\n0:24:00 – 0:24:14\n\nI don't think they are focusing on this particular technology at this point in time.\n0:24:14 – 0:24:18\n\nOkay.\n0:24:18 – 0:24:18\n\nI hardly see any requirement coming from any individual or any manager to get their team or themselves skilled on JNAI.\n0:24:18 – 0:24:30\n\nI mean I'm going to ignore data because that will not be relevant here but in terms of let's say the culture right the way that you envision it.\n0:24:30 – 0:24:52\n\nSo what I see is there are rule sets and there are delivery patterns and we want our team is automatically saying here these are delivery patterns I want to add her to it.\n0:24:52 – 0:25:06\n\nSo innovation is gets stifled because I have to finish this off deliver this off I have to learn on these deliveries so I'm breast of it.\n0:25:06 – 0:25:18\n\nBut innovation side and again I'm talking about the culture and the innovation and how you want to drive that.\n0:25:18 – 0:25:24\n\nDo you think that there is scope where you would want employees to say I want to go try this out or I mean are you portraying that innovative thing as a culture or it's more about operations because this business is operations right.\n0:25:24 – 0:25:38\n\nThis is integration and operation.\n0:25:38 – 0:25:40\n\nSo what is the what is your vision on the culture side of things.\n0:25:40 – 0:25:44\n\nOn the culture side I would say that in terms of the innovation yes one has to keep on innovating at the individual level at the organization level itself.\n0:25:44 – 0:25:54\n\nBut there are a lot of innovations which are happening across various kind of technologies various kind of tools which are happening and JNAI used to be one of them.\n0:25:54 – 0:26:02\n\nSo I would still see that this is more applicable to the organization which are handling huge number of service calls or huge number of product outlays.\n0:26:02 – 0:26:14\n\nAnd I see a lot of absorption of these particular things in the software development also where in terms of the coding itself people go to some of the tools like chat GP and they say this is the problem and the code comes in.\n0:26:14 – 0:26:26\n\nAnd some of the people that I have spoken to yes they are seeing the absorption is very high.\n0:26:26 – 0:26:32\n\nLot of people at the working level they are using these kind of tools building up those kind of codes using these tools and I think the success what they see is almost close to 80 to 85 percent.\n0:26:32 – 0:26:44\n\nAfter that they need to still do the fine tuning and make it workable as per their environment.\n0:26:44 – 0:26:50\n\nI think these are specifically in the software coding those kind of testing those kind of product launches interfaces or the banking or the consumer segment or I would say in terms of advertising company creating lot of content around text or around videos or around images.\n0:26:50 – 0:27:12\n\nI think there is lot of potential in that particular area.\n0:27:12 – 0:27:14\n\nAbsolutely and since we are not into that so the focus in terms of innovating around these kind of things internally in our organization is a bit limited.\n0:27:14 – 0:27:22\n\nAbsolutely and I mean I have been actually talking with a lot of these company CTOs and CEOs I told you and the number seems at 80 percent is not actually there to be very frank with you.\n0:27:22 – 0:27:34\n\nThe number with development and other places is like roughly around 20 to 30 percent and with things like you said I mean in terms of them getting documents and marketing and all is around 50 percent.\n0:27:34 – 0:27:52\n\nSo that's basically the benchmarks that I have got from I mean around 50 people that I have already interviewed and one place where I see a major difference has been made is in terms of ticketing and supports.\n0:27:52 – 0:28:06\n\nRight because of GEN.AI ticketing and support has become tremendously cheap and it doesn't need somebody to understand and learn GEN.AI because very soon the products which are coming will automatically package that in and bring it forward.\n0:28:06 – 0:28:22\n\nRight so there will be a let's say a ticket management tool that automatically handles your kind of queries and automatically answers back and gets those. So as I said I mean we have been able to save a lot of billions of dollars in terms of L1 support and ticket answering and customer query resolution etc etc.\n0:28:22 – 0:28:44\n\nSo that's one avenue I mean which probably comes in your domain and lies under your view of things. What do you feel about that one?\n0:28:44 – 0:28:52\n\nYeah I will agree with you on this and I think things have changed massively in this particular domain. If you remember at least a decade back for any kind of consumer support there used to be a helpless number.\n0:28:52 – 0:29:04\n\nYes.\n0:29:04 – 0:29:04\n\nYou used to call them and you start interacting then it became I would say you call and then there were certain options which were given 1, 2 and 3 to do various kind of activities.\n0:29:04 – 0:29:14\n\nIVL.\n0:29:14 – 0:29:14\n\nWhen you go to lot of companies on the service page itself there is no human interface which is provisioned. There is not even a telephone number which is given. It is all automated.\n0:29:14 – 0:29:26\n\nYou have to just go through that particular thing and I am sure almost around 99% of the queries are sorted out and those 1% still struggle to figure out how to resolve that but I think 99% is not a bad number.\n0:29:26 – 0:29:38\n\nCompanies have reached to that level that they have removed this particular human interface itself. It means that they have reached the level where they wanted to.\n0:29:38 – 0:29:46\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n0:29:46 – 0:29:48\n\nThat is one area where there is lot of benefit which has been realized. Obviously it's not a right thing but at the cost of the employment of lot of people but I don't think that can be addressed by any means.\n0:29:48 – 0:30:04\n\nThe technology will keep on moving and people have to align with that in terms of becoming more productive around that and adding value to the organization.\n0:30:04 – 0:30:12\n\nI totally agree with you. I totally agree with you.\n0:30:12 – 0:30:14\n\nSo I am down to my last three questions. If you had the chance of knowing what you know today about GNI and the features and functions like we discussed. If you roll back your clock one year, you have a chance of going back one year. Is there anything you would have done differently?\n0:30:14 – 0:30:36\n\nTo be very frank, if you ask me, at our level when we are working or maybe the senior management which is working, getting into those kind of things in terms of tools like chat, GPT, I don't think I would have ever used it in the last two years in spite of the hype which has been created.\n0:30:36 – 0:30:54\n\nOr maybe at the team leads level, yes, at the people down below, they find it very handy in terms of preparing the reports and presenting it. The only challenge which comes is that they start blindly relying on those.\n0:30:54 – 0:31:08\n\nThat is stupid. That really goes bad.\n0:31:08 – 0:31:10\n\nYeah, so taking assistance is not an issue but then you have to go through and you need to know what you are presenting. So that level of depth I think that we are compromising at the lower level itself.\n0:31:10 – 0:31:24\n\nWhere the sharpness of the people in terms of analyzing those particular things based on the data, they are relying more on the tools. So I think the intelligent portion or the analytical skills are going to get impacted on that.\n0:31:24 – 0:31:38\n\nAbsolutely. You are absolutely right on that. And I mean, probably if you would go back one year, you would probably say, hey, do not use these.\n0:31:38 – 0:31:48\n\nProbably. I mean, you would probably create some process or some rule around it and say, hey, do not use this, isn't it?\n0:31:48 – 0:31:54\n\nVery fine. Whatever you may do, people will figure out. There is no point putting those kinds of checks and balances in today's environment. You stop that people should not access the, I would say, the Facebook from the office network itself. They will move on to the personal lot.\n0:31:54 – 0:32:12\n\nThere is no point doing those kinds of things themselves. I think we have moved ahead from those kinds of checks and balances and the limitations which have been imposed to the new generation.\n0:32:12 – 0:32:22\n\nBut those things do not affect our work output and the company output. But if you blindly follow something like a chat GPT and you give me just copy paste, that is going to affect my final outcome, right?\n0:32:22 – 0:32:34\n\nWhich is going to be bad. And if somebody is doing it once, I'll probably live with it. But if somebody is repeatedly doing something like this, right, it's going to be harmful for the organization and for the quality.\n0:32:34 – 0:32:46\n\nI think both the things have their own impacts. Even the social media, the kind of the impact in terms of people spending the time around those particular tools.\n0:32:46 – 0:32:54\n\nThat's brainless.\n0:32:54 – 0:32:56\n\nThat's also, I mean, it's an impact from a different perspective.\n0:32:56 – 0:32:58\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:32:58 – 0:33:00\n\nThis is directly impact on what you are producing or what you are delivering.\n0:33:00 – 0:33:04\n\nSo one is an impact on time, the other is an impact on quality basically.\n0:33:04 – 0:33:06\n\nRight.\n0:33:06 – 0:33:08\n\nIf we look at all this that has happened, what do you think, right, is your opinion in terms of, let's say, in the next few years, right?\n0:33:08 – 0:33:24\n\nIs it going to be helpful still for the business or because of the nature of our business, right? It's still going to be similar, right? And these new technologies coming in might not affect that much of our operations.\n0:33:24 – 0:33:40\n\nAgain, it will of course affect the world or other things. But in terms of what we do, what we focus on, it might not affect. What's your take?\n0:33:40 – 0:33:48\n\nI think the kind of the business that we are into, which is more government centric, government will take their own sweet time in terms of going on those particular things.\n0:33:48 – 0:33:56\n\nAnd these kind of technologies are more dynamic in nature, which are slightly, I would say, unpredictable.\n0:33:56 – 0:34:02\n\nYeah, it is.\n0:34:02 – 0:34:02\n\nAnd the impact what we also believe that it's getting impacted by, I would say, there are based on the certain biases also which can be created on the source of the information which these tools are using.\n0:34:02 – 0:34:18\n\nSo, the kind of the sources of the data that these guys are using for presenting those kind of reports and the kind of the technologies which are available, those kind of, I would say, biases can be created and we have seen the allegations of elections getting maneuvered, not only in India and US and all the places also.\n0:34:18 – 0:34:36\n\nSo, lot of big fake technologies and lot of these kind of biases which get generated, to what extent it has impacted, no one knows to be very frank. But I am sure there are impacts on those particular technologies which are not working in a controlled environment.\n0:34:36 – 0:34:50\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:34:50 – 0:34:52\n\nAnd there are people who are always going to misuse anything more than the users. So, I think, yes, the utilization is going to increase. But the sector that we are operating in, people will be cautious absorbing those kind of technologies till the time entire validation has happened and they are doubly sure of what they are getting.\n0:34:52 – 0:35:12\n\nI understand that. And I mean, I really loved your quote on this one that, hey, I mean, it's fine that they will use this and everything. But end of the day, I want my people to go through it because the nuances are important, right? For me, those are the important things and that's something that I will quote to others when I talk to them about this one, right, this particular use case.\n0:35:12 – 0:35:34\n\nMy last question to you, Kishan, and this is more on the, what would be your recommendation for companies in your domain and companies like you? Hey, don't waste your time on GNI, right? Focus more on where you get value, the impact that you are getting. What is your recommendation to them about GNI in terms of other players?\n0:35:34 – 0:36:02\n\nMy recommendation is everything brings the advantages. So, we need to see where those particular technologies have to be used. Like, as I mentioned, interacting with your customers for the kind of the album calls that you mentioned.\n0:36:02 – 0:36:14\n\nWe're going to help in terms of optimizing the cost and the resolution time for the organization and for the customer. Yes, definitely these should be used. And then those particular things have to be done in slightly a controlled environment where it doesn't impact your customer or your organization itself.\n0:36:14 – 0:36:32\n\nSo, the validations and checks and balances are very important for this. So, on the consumer interface side, I definitely see a lot of utilization on that. And maybe in internal consumptions, when there are certain presentations or certain things which have to be presented internally or certain new things which have to be streamlined because always people will keep on coming up with the newer things, you will keep on deploying the technology, your people will keep on countering those particular things.\n0:36:32 – 0:37:00\n\nYou will deploy GPS-based kind of solutions for their attendance, for their convenience. And then as I understand that there are spy GPS applications which are available. We are sitting from your home, you can punch the GPS location from your office.\n0:37:00 – 0:37:16\n\nVery easily. So, every tool comes with a counter also. So, we need to be very sure in terms of what we are absorbing. And we should not stop absorbing the technologies for these kind of fears because the impact will be only 1-2% will misuse that. 98-99% of people are going to use that. So, these kind of technologies are welcome. But after due validation and assessing the impact, those should get absorbed.\n0:37:16 – 0:37:44\n\nThe productivity is very important and that is where the value that we contribute and I would say eventually it boils down to your satisfaction in terms of the job that you are doing and in terms of the competition that you carry. So, the more value you add to the organization and to yourself, you are going to benefit in all the aspects.\n0:37:44 – 0:38:02\n\nAbsolutely. So, that gives me all the answers that I needed. Thank you so much. One question that is out of curiosity and this is not a part of my list is, what is that one biggest problem that you currently have in the kind of organization that you are running that if handled can make a biggest impact possible on the business?\n0:38:02 – 0:38:30\n\nLook, the biggest challenge that I find at this point of time is in spite of best of the technologies and best of the tools that are available, the communication between the people is not happening to the extent it should happen. So, the right information flowing at the right time doesn't happen.\n0:38:30 – 0:38:56\n\nThere is a delay in terms of the implementation. So, we have best of the tools but when it comes to the process and in terms of the ability to involve people and communicate and close. So, it has nothing to do with technology.\n0:38:56 – 0:39:12\n\nIt has to do with the, I would say, the ability of the people to get everyone along whether it is their subordinates or their peers or their supervisors so as to get everyone along because individually people can't deliver to that extent and it's always a teamwork.\n0:39:12 – 0:39:28\n\nIt's difficult to work in a team and communicate with them in spite of best of the tools which are available. Today, you have the kind of the WhatsApp group. Most of the communication has moved on that. In spite of that, you see those kind of challenges. Either you are overwhelmed with number of WhatsApp group or the irrelevant information and relevant information gets missed out. So, having that kind of right communication channels is very important.\n0:39:28 – 0:39:52\n\nNothing to do with the tools and technologies. So, is it a problem where people are either getting overwhelmed with information or not getting information? Is that the problem or it's people's behavior towards the information that they have received?\n0:39:52 – 0:40:08\n\nI would say it's more to do with the behavior of the people at this point of time. New generation, the kind of the expectation they have from the job and from the organization.\n0:40:08 – 0:40:22\n\nShould I stop recording? This might not be something.\n0:40:22 – 0:40:24\n\n\nPresto Infosolutions a leading System Integrator, is committed to provide Quality Information Lifecycle Management, Video Conferencing and Surveillance, IT Consulting and Implementation services to the customers while helping them achieve competitive edge through the use of Information Technology.\n\nOur team of Consultants are on the cusp of emerging technologies that help customers lower overall costs and improve productivity.

        "content": "Great. So three parts. First part, generic, what your views will be referenced upon. So the industry sector, company size, etc., just to make the cohort balanced.\n0:00:00 – 0:00:16\n\nOkay.\n0:00:16 – 0:00:17\n\nSecond part, specific takeaways in terms of what are the tangible plus, minus, benefits, losses in terms of generic AI.\n0:00:17 – 0:00:29\n\nAnd the third would be more of opinion driven, where what's your opinion and how things go forward, right?\n0:00:29 – 0:00:35\n\nYeah, got it.\n0:00:35 – 0:00:37\n\nPerfect. So first part of it, most of your opinions would come from what industry and what sector for the sake of this interview recording.\n0:00:37 – 0:00:48\n\nIt's all tech, it's all primarily software development and education.\n0:00:48 – 0:00:55\n\nPerfect. And I mean, in terms of company size, if we talk number of employees and revenue.\n0:00:55 – 0:01:00\n\nRevenue can't disclose since it's private.\n0:01:00 – 0:01:05\n\nSure.\n0:01:05 – 0:01:06\n\nNumber of people working is 1000 to 2000.\n0:01:06 – 0:01:14\n\nPerfect. That works. Now, we will focus specifically on gen AI, AI being the larger part. We're just going to squeeze it down to only gen AI.\n0:01:14 – 0:01:25\n\nThat's a target here. So to begin with, what would be the biggest tangible benefit, right?\n0:01:25 – 0:01:35\n\nWhich can boil down to dollar value that you have seen using gen AI so far.\n0:01:35 – 0:01:41\n\nSo I would basically say the average productivity of a knowledge worker has improved by 2x.\n0:01:41 – 0:01:55\n\nAt the very minimum and up to 10x at the top it.\n0:01:55 – 0:02:00\n\nSo 2 to 10x.\n0:02:00 – 0:02:02\n\nYeah.\n0:02:02 – 0:02:04\n\nOkay. And this is a bit generic. So if we can go a bit specific when we say average productivity of a knowledge worker, what exactly are we meaning here?\n0:02:04 – 0:02:14\n\nSo productivity is measured in two different ways.\n0:02:14 – 0:02:17\n\nThe number of hours to get a unit work done has been halved and the total throughput of the person that they are able to kind of get done over a period of time is significantly higher as well.\n0:02:17 – 0:02:37\n\nAlso the quality of the work and the consistency has improved dramatically.\n0:02:37 – 0:02:43\n\nSo it's basically the time throughput and quality of work.\n0:02:43 – 0:02:47\n\nCorrect.\n0:02:47 – 0:02:48\n\nAlright. Great. Great.\n0:02:48 – 0:02:51\n\nAnd when we say that tangibly this is like 2 to 10x, what is our measurement based upon?\n0:02:51 – 0:02:58\n\nWe are using these three as we are tracking them using our proprietary tools that we are doing.\n0:02:58 – 0:03:05\n\nPartly that but secondly also for example the number of shippable components or the number of shipped releases, the pace of releases that are happening, all of those count towards what we consider productivity.\n0:03:05 – 0:03:23\n\nGreat. Great.\n0:03:23 – 0:03:25\n\nWhat would be the second highest if you would say in terms of tangible benefits of GEN.AI that you have been able to see so far?\n0:03:25 – 0:03:34\n\nSorry could you repeat that question again?\n0:03:34 – 0:03:36\n\nI said what would be the second highest tangible benefit that you would have seen for GEN.AI so far?\n0:03:36 – 0:03:42\n\nI would say it's primarily the quality and consistency of the end work product and much better governance of work being done.\n0:03:42 – 0:03:57\n\nOkay is this different from the quality and throughput we discussed in the first part about the knowledge worker and his productivity?\n0:03:57 – 0:04:04\n\nYeah I mean usually quality does not get countered to productivity on hindsight.\n0:04:04 – 0:04:09\n\nI mean it is a bar in how much you get done.\n0:04:09 – 0:04:14\n\nOkay.\n0:04:14 – 0:04:15\n\nBut it's usually not countered in productivity.\n0:04:15 – 0:04:18\n\nOkay.\n0:04:18 – 0:04:19\n\nQuality is a separate aspect of doing work.\n0:04:19 – 0:04:24\n\nAlright and how do we measure that this quality has gone up?\n0:04:24 – 0:04:29\n\nIs it in terms of customer satisfaction?\n0:04:29 – 0:04:34\n\nWhat's the term of deciding that hey quality has really gone up by 2x, 10x, 5x whatever?\n0:04:34 – 0:04:40\n\nYeah so it is measured in terms of whatever the unit of work is for example if you are bringing in software products then it is the number of releases that you have actually shipped to customers.\n0:04:40 – 0:04:54\n\nWhich basically again ties down to productivity in some sense.\n0:04:54 – 0:05:00\n\nNo the quality bar is vacant to it because for example you may do a release but you may not ship it to a customer.\n0:05:00 – 0:05:09\n\nYou will ship something to a customer only when you believe that it is good enough.\n0:05:09 – 0:05:13\n\nAlright so productivity we would say this is the number of releases we are doing but quality we would say number of releases shipped.\n0:05:13 – 0:05:20\n\nShipped to a customer yes.\n0:05:20 – 0:05:24\n\nGot it.\n0:05:24 – 0:05:25\n\nNow again these two are quite generic in terms of usage and here the target is that there are so many companies who are aspiring or already working on Gen.EI and what takeaways they can take from here\n0:05:25 – 0:05:38\n\nand I mean what takeaways they can take in terms of hey these are the things that we can really do well with Gen.EI or we should not do with Gen.EI right?\n0:05:38 – 0:05:44\n\nSo specifically in terms is it software development that we are talking about?\n0:05:44 – 0:05:50\n\nIt can also be in terms of support or the products we have developed right maybe support maybe towards HR maybe towards some particular industry right?\n0:05:50 – 0:05:59\n\nSo in terms of quality and in terms of let's say if you go down a bit deeper what part of quality is affected the most with Gen.EI for now in your opinion tangibly?\n0:05:59 – 0:06:13\n\nSo I would say that any work that is knowledge based which means it could be anything from being a support person, it could be anyone who is collecting, curating, analyzing data, anyone who is writing code anywhere where it's not manual labor but it actually requires using knowledge, using human intellect to do something.\n0:06:13 – 0:06:39\n\nIn virtually every one of those cases you can actually leverage AI in three different ways.\n0:06:39 – 0:06:46\n\nThe first way is using AI to learn faster, learn better.\n0:06:46 – 0:06:51\n\nAI brings a whole lot of knowledge to you in a personalized, consumable manner which has never been, you've never been able to do that before right?\n0:06:51 – 0:07:02\n\nThe second one is being able to take AI and create what I would call a spiky point of view which is something that is unique to you.\n0:07:02 – 0:07:19\n\nSo think of something that is important and something that experts would disagree on.\n0:07:19 – 0:07:25\n\nOkay so that means if there was a statement that you feel is, you believe is very important to doing something that I could say you are a developer, you have an opinion about how code should be formatted right?\n0:07:25 – 0:07:40\n\nAnd if you put it out there amongst experts, they might disagree on how it should be formatted whether tabs or spaces, that's a classic argument on this right?\n0:07:40 – 0:07:53\n\nThe idea of using AI or giving AI a set of very well thought out spiky points of view which is basically things that are important and things that are going to be debatable by experts because\n0:07:53 – 0:08:12\n\nunderstand this that all LLMs are trained on world knowledge which basically means that they are going to give you only the average amount of knowledge or they will not make any decisions.\n0:08:12 – 0:08:26\n\nBut once you can spar with an LLM to come up with a set of beliefs that you think are important and that experts will disagree on and make that the underlying foundational virtue of DLLM.\n0:08:26 – 0:08:45\n\nSo basically what you are trying to say is that hey if you have a great point of view that you want to put forward you can actually validate, sort it out, brainstorm and come to a final conclusive point of view that you can use further on, is that correct?\n0:08:45 – 0:08:59\n\nNot only that you can also tell the LLM that going forward that LLM is only going to use that point of view for whatever it does.\n0:08:59 – 0:09:06\n\nWhich is a very important aspect of, in effect that is the IP in a generative way.\n0:09:06 – 0:09:19\n\nAnd last one is that to actually get the work done, LLMs can actually make better output and faster output because you are not sitting and searching through.\n0:09:19 – 0:09:37\n\nFor example if you are writing code you are not going to sample, store, google for any of that.\n0:09:37 – 0:09:46\n\nThat's right.\n0:09:46 – 0:09:48\n\nAnd a lot of complete stuff for you, in fact if you just give it a PRD for a requirements document, it can go.\n0:09:48 – 0:09:55\n\nThen pretty much write the most of it.\n0:09:55 – 0:09:59\n\nGot it.\n0:09:59 – 0:10:03\n\nSo those are all the three ways that almost anybody who is not doing it or who is working on knowledge or who is the knowledge worker can actually leverage.\n0:10:03 – 0:10:17\n\nFew things that would probably counter there.\n0:10:17 – 0:10:25\n\nSo you said learning, you said we can use AI for the spiky point of view, we can use AI to get the work done faster.\n0:10:25 – 0:10:32\n\nThe on ground problems that people face with these is one, learning, there are times when it might really teach you which is something that is not okay, something that might be sounding absolutely correct when it's saying it.\n0:10:32 – 0:10:49\n\nBut very small change that might actually throw it off meaning.\n0:10:49 – 0:10:53\n\nSo it has to be validated and corrected and moved on which is one task there additionally.\n0:10:53 – 0:11:01\n\nSecond, in terms of a spiky point of view, there are a lot of times when it goes conformist, right.\n0:11:01 – 0:11:07\n\nSo it will basically confirm what you are trying to say, unless you are actually able to trash that out, right.\n0:11:07 – 0:11:13\n\nAnd in terms of the work done, there are a lot of times, sorry, go ahead.\n0:11:13 – 0:11:20\n\nYes, this actually raises your first two points. Number one is learning. You have to learn not just from one source, but you have to have a good learning system built with AI that is fed with all the data that needs to be learned.\n0:11:20 – 0:11:39\n\nIt can't be generic stuff. It has to be very, very delicate. So, I mean, it's like anything you can, if you want to learn science or history or something like that, you can go and pick up really bad books or you can go and pick up really good books.\n0:11:39 – 0:11:59\n\nRight. And it's all subjective and it's opinion making. Right. So it's very similar with AI. You have to suggest, you have to have, and the good thing is that now you have all the tools to double check and fast-check what we say.\n0:11:59 – 0:12:18\n\nSo part of learning is also being able to validate it. Experimenting with it.\n0:12:18 – 0:12:24\n\nRight. You have a hypothesis. You find all the two points for it. You find all the citations for it. You look those up and that's part of the learning process.\n0:12:24 – 0:12:32\n\nRight. Learning process is not just a one-shot thing.\n0:12:32 – 0:12:37\n\nRight. So it's basically an expectation problem where people expect, hey, it's going to give me all the answers. It's not going to give you the answer. You need to still figure it out and find it out.\n0:12:37 – 0:12:49\n\nRight. It's basically a problem with expectations. It's like people expected, hey, I'm going to throw it a question, it's going to give me the right answer, which is not the case. Right. You'll have to still drill down.\n0:12:49 – 0:13:03\n\nRight. Great. That answers this part. In terms of, I'll take one more great case. You said we are able to get the productivity really up. We are able to improve the quality a lot.\n0:13:03 – 0:13:29\n\nIs there any specific case where you can say, hey, I really got X dollar value benefit out of only GNI?\n0:13:29 – 0:13:38\n\nSo, like I said, we are computing in pure dollar value, but if you get a simple map that you can do it, if you have that to its productivity, then it's really simple to say, attach a dollar value to it because you know how much a person costs.\n0:13:38 – 0:14:07\n\nCorrect. What we are trying to look at is basically a specific case. Like this is quite generic in terms of software development. Right. Is there any specific case you would like to share?\n0:14:07 – 0:14:19\n\nLet's take an example of development. A typical release takes about three months to put out with all the checks, quality checks, all the tests and the whole process of doing a release. These days, we are able to put out a release every two or three weeks with all the sources and checks and everything else in place.\n0:14:19 – 0:14:46\n\nWhich means that in a year we get out three times as many releases as we did in the past.\n0:14:46 – 0:14:52\n\nWhich means that our customers renew their contracts, you can just feel like they are actually doing something.\n0:14:52 – 0:15:03\n\nIt's a big enabler in all of that stuff. Make sense. And if we look at the flip side, what was it where you really tried hard, you focused hard, but GNI could not deliver?\n0:15:03 – 0:15:23\n\nThere are things where GNI is not yet where it needs to be to do a bunch of stuff. For example, I'll put it this way. It's not a question of I tried very hard and it didn't work. It's a question of what is GNI the right tool to use to create productivity and efficiency.\n0:15:23 – 0:15:49\n\nThat is the question you asked. GNI is not an answer for everything. If GNI was the answer for everything, then you would basically go back and ask the question the way you asked it.\n0:15:49 – 0:16:02\n\nIf you understand where GNI is the most appropriate tool and how to leverage it the right way, then the question you would ask is, does GNI have the ability to solve this problem given the current state of the models and how do we leverage it in the right way to make that happen?\n0:16:02 – 0:16:25\n\nLet me change the question a bit in that context. The question is, what are the aspects where you feel that, hey, we thought GNI could deliver a lot, but it didn't turn out that it was mature enough to deliver a lot in that aspect?\n0:16:25 – 0:16:40\n\nSo I'll give you an example where, for example, in the evening, or even today on Twitter, you will see a kind of conversation about how somebody with no coding experience went ahead and went happy in 20 minutes.\n0:16:40 – 0:16:58\n\nNow that in itself is a mis-information, because you're not building a production app in that amount of time. You are building a simple prototype that is in show-supplies.\n0:16:58 – 0:17:22\n\nBut the impression that people create is that, oh, without coding experience or without knowing how to build a production app, I can go ahead and build a production app and enjoy the news.\n0:17:22 – 0:17:34\n\nYeah, I fully agree with that. I think the impression is going to be that, oh, I'm just going to go in and I'm going to say, give me an app that's an amazing CRO that we all just practically get done. I think that's just huge setting expectations. I wouldn't say that you go in thinking, this is going to work. But I see that happening with a lot of folks.\n0:17:34 – 0:17:56\n\nThat's right. So in the long run, you see that that's going to happen, but right now it's not there yet.\n0:17:56 – 0:18:04\n\nI don't even know if that is going to happen. For a simple reason, just if you look at the concept of information loss, if I have to suggest it will be an awesome CRM, the amount of information loss that is there, from what is there in my mind about what an awesome CRM is.\n0:18:04 – 0:18:33\n\nThere's a world of this, right?\n0:18:33 – 0:18:37\n\nThat's correct.\n0:18:37 – 0:18:38\n\nI have all kinds of details about what makes an awesome CRM in my head, but if I just say, oh, build me an awesome CRM, there's a massive amount of information loss. And when the LLM is trying to reconstruct what an awesome CRM is going to be, it's going to be inside of what an awesome CRM is.\n0:18:38 – 0:18:56\n\nIt's kind of misguided. Right? When you have information loss and you're trying to build it all back, you're never going to get that distinction because there was loss in the videos.\n0:18:56 – 0:19:08\n\nThat's correct. Agreed.\n0:19:08 – 0:19:10\n\nSo, I am not sure you will get it like that. However, I do believe that you will get it good enough to a point where if you express the intent in the right way, you will get it amazing.\n0:19:10 – 0:19:26\n\nOkay. So that was one accord of where people are misconstrued on the accord that it's going to just deliver what I'm thinking, right? Without telling it in the right way or exposing it in the right way.\n0:19:26 – 0:19:39\n\nWhat other thing did you notice probably in terms of communication, in terms of directly human touch applications or whatever other applications that hey, we assume that it's going to be great at this, but the final results or the end results were not that great.\n0:19:39 – 0:20:00\n\nI don't think we ever went in with that notion. We actually went in with a very open mind to understand what can it do and then where can we apply it.\n0:20:00 – 0:20:13\n\nWe didn't come into any of these thinking, oh, this will solve all our problems. Let's go all around. That was almost never the case. I can't think of a single scenario where that would be.\n0:20:13 – 0:20:26\n\nSpecific use case or specific problem solving like, hey, I mean, it's going to solve the problem where our L1 has to no longer actually take support cases, right?\n0:20:26 – 0:20:37\n\nWe could probably offload the entire L1 to it or specific use cases like this where you had good notion that hey, this with all the information that we have so far would really work great.\n0:20:37 – 0:20:48\n\nBut whenever we are wanting to deliver it, there is like, it's not there yet. That kind of. Yeah, it's basically a bunch of gaps.\n0:20:48 – 0:20:57\n\nSo, for example, maybe the model has the capability to do it, but maybe our knowledge bases are terrible. That could be one of the reasons. It's not that the L1 is incapable, but you may not have all the pieces that you need to get a particular kind of work done.\n0:20:57 – 0:21:15\n\nCorrect. So any such case that you have witnessed or you feel like, hey, this is something I saw?\n0:21:15 – 0:21:21\n\nYeah, I mean, for example, code refactoring of very, very large code bases anywhere from two to five million like this code.\n0:21:21 – 0:21:31\n\nIt's a non-trivial. It is a non-trivial exercise. And particularly when you don't have any developer who even understands the code base, then there's a big challenge because you have to validate what the LLM is doing.\n0:21:31 – 0:21:45\n\nYou don't understand what the code base is. You don't know whether the output of the LLM is the right output or not. So there are multiple challenges when you tackle that.\n0:21:45 – 0:21:54\n\nRight. Right. I had both the examples where, I mean, we assume, I mean, not exactly we assume, but I mean, people would assume that, hey, this is going to do great.\n0:21:54 – 0:22:07\n\nOne in terms of, hey, it will give me a code if I give it a code. I mean, it's not that simple or straightforward. It's going to take my entire code base.\n0:22:07 – 0:22:15\n\nI don't need anybody to just understand the code base and develop something for me. That's also not possible.\n0:22:15 – 0:22:19\n\nAnything other than the code base or other than specific development that you had?\n0:22:19 – 0:22:23\n\nI won't say it's not possible. It's not a question. It's not possible. It is very hard to validate whether that's the right answer or not.\n0:22:23 – 0:22:30\n\nCorrect. The output cannot be validated. Output is hard to validate. I'm not saying it cannot be. Again, I will never use definitive terms because it doesn't make sense.\n0:22:30 – 0:22:41\n\nRight. Okay. If I had 500 people who were experts in this sort of, yeah, they absolutely could validate me. So to answer your question, it's not so easy to do that.\n0:22:41 – 0:22:57\n\nGot it. Right. So other than these two cases, any other field you feel it's not that easy and specifically with LLM?\n0:22:57 – 0:23:08\n\nYeah, I think one of the aspects of the fundamental mindset change that comes from generative AI is the expectation that your output is going to be deterministic.\n0:23:08 – 0:23:21\n\nThat's right. There are a lot of people who come from the old world who don't understand that you want to use generative AI in cases where the ask is hard and the expectation of a deterministic answer is not a make-or-break situation.\n0:23:21 – 0:23:41\n\nYeah. Yeah. Got it. And what do you feel it's, I mean, is the, so let us say if a company is looking at using a solution, so a lot of these companies do not have the caliber to go develop a lot of tools, right?\n0:23:41 – 0:24:06\n\nThey go forward with market tools who claim to be, let us say, solving their L1 problem or saying, hey, you can actually have cold calls happening through LLM, right?\n0:24:06 – 0:24:21\n\nOr things like those where these SMEs or the smaller companies, I mean, can we really benefit out of it? Some of these do give them, let's say, some X return, some of these quickly fizzle out and like it's a no benefit.\n0:24:21 – 0:24:37\n\nWhat do you see that for a, let's say, small to medium enterprise who do not have capabilities to, of course, develop things in using LLM or Gen.EI, how could Gen.EI benefit them in terms of regular business practices, their HR, their, let's say, support, their sales, their marketing?\n0:24:37 – 0:24:58\n\nWhat would be the, what would be your advice for them? So, number one, I think it's a miss. No more that these smaller companies cannot do Gen.EI products.\n0:24:58 – 0:25:09\n\nI think for the first time, technology has or the Gen.EI capability has evolved to a point where you actually can't. There are literally one man teams that are building, you know, $100 million resources.\n0:25:09 – 0:25:25\n\nAnd this has never been possible before, but now it can.\n0:25:25 – 0:25:29\n\nSo I think the notion that you need massive teams to do and lots of money to do Gen.EI is I think very, very false.\n0:25:29 – 0:25:40\n\nI agree with you.\n0:25:40 – 0:25:41\n\nSo it's actually democratize AI to the masses.\n0:25:41 – 0:25:46\n\nSecond, it has always been a problem where you have software products with all kinds of claims. You have to try to test it and you have to figure out whether it is suitable for your setup or not.\n0:25:46 – 0:26:00\n\nAnd if you don't, then you have the same suite as earlier.\n0:26:00 – 0:26:05\n\nSo I think that part doesn't change. Just the number of decisions you have to make come down drastically because it's easier to test, it's easier to check, it's easier to run now than ever before.\n0:26:05 – 0:26:21\n\nThat makes sense.\n0:26:21 – 0:26:25\n\nNow, we'll just go a bit deeper into a few aspects like people. Okay. And for in your aspect, do you think that Gen.EI is something that every team should say this is a must for you to use right now?\n0:26:25 – 0:26:45\n\nBecause if you're not using it, you're losing things.\n0:26:45 – 0:26:47\n\nIt should be like, hey, I mean, I don't care whether you use Gen.EI or not as long as you're giving me X productivity or you should use judiciously Gen.EI or you should not use at all.\n0:26:47 – 0:26:59\n\nAnd I have had different answers from different people on all these four.\n0:26:59 – 0:27:04\n\nWhat is your take at? I already know your take, but yeah, for the sake of interview.\n0:27:04 – 0:27:10\n\nIf you're not playing around with all the different models for AI in a very focused solution oriented manner, what I mean by that is, if you're not going out there and constantly trying out a different, you know, different solutions, different elements, or even experimenting, then basically in today's day and age, you're not innovating.\n0:27:10 – 0:27:39\n\nThat's right. And like all innovation for all time, if you're not innovating, you're going to get out of business sooner or later.\n0:27:39 – 0:27:51\n\nOf these four, you would say that yeah, it should be actively pushed, it should be passively pushed or it should be left to the employee as your advice for others.\n0:27:51 – 0:28:03\n\nNo, it's got to be very actively pushed because going and doing something new or different is not human nature.\n0:28:03 – 0:28:10\n\nPerfect.\n0:28:10 – 0:28:11\n\nIt's not regular human nature. So, it's really important that as an organization, there's a culture of experimenting and trying things out.\n0:28:11 – 0:28:23\n\nGreat. Now, with this comes another issue and that is in terms of data. Many people are not very comfortable about sharing a lot of their data with these companies which are giving solutions.\n0:28:23 – 0:28:38\n\nIf they are using their own data on, let us say, LLM companies, some of these people who do not have, let's say, privacy, let's say, things in place, they are a bit worried, hey, I mean, will the company be using my data?\n0:28:38 – 0:28:55\n\nIn most cases, that might not be true. In some cases, that might be true. But then again, that was a problem that had been there for a long time, right?\n0:28:55 – 0:29:02\n\nWhat would be the advice that you would give that here is how an employee should be managing the data such that you still have data privacy, you still have everything in place and you are still using your LLM and your GNI in a better way?\n0:29:02 – 0:29:18\n\nI actually don't see this in that, in that lens at all. All business is a trade-off between risk and rewards. Everything is a risk. We don't have to measure whether there is some worth the reward or not.\n0:29:18 – 0:29:33\n\nWhen people talk about data privacy security, you have to weigh the risk of it. What is the risk of the data going out?\n0:29:33 – 0:29:41\n\nSo, are you saying that there is a fair chance that data will go out so you have to just focus on the risk and reward rather than that?\n0:29:41 – 0:29:49\n\nI mean, good or not, okay? I mean, just like, you know, when you employ somebody, right? Why does the company employ somebody? Because there is a fair chance that person can take company data and share it outside.\n0:29:49 – 0:30:06\n\nCorrect. Right. Even if you have a contract, even if you have an NDA, no matter what you have, there is nothing that prevents an employee from going out and, you know, talking to a competitor.\n0:30:06 – 0:30:19\n\nThat's right. And once the data is out, I mean, once the data is out, the data is out, right? Does that mean you will never hire anybody?\n0:30:19 – 0:30:29\n\nOf course not. Right. So, then we basically have the risk and reward. You weigh the risks and reward. You're like, okay, if I have this employee, there is a 20% chance that this person is going to go and speak to somebody else.\n0:30:29 – 0:30:44\n\nBut there is an 80% chance that I can actually ship the product and get some revenue. Right.\n0:30:44 – 0:30:50\n\nSo, you weigh the risks and the rewards and you decide what works. You know, where is your sweet spot for where you're willing to take some risks, but I guess rewards.\n0:30:50 – 0:31:00\n\nSo, in terms of absolutes that data privacy is the most important thing, whatever, that's never the case.\n0:31:00 – 0:31:08\n\nThere can be two companies in the same line of business, doing the same kinds of operations. However, the risk reward criteria for one business owner might be completely different from the other.\n0:31:08 – 0:31:22\n\nMakes sense. And so, I'm never going to dictate, you know, exactly what you should or shouldn't do, but I do believe that you should look at all the risks, you know, weigh the rewards that come with these risks and you make a decision as to whether it's appropriate for your appetite or not.\n0:31:22 – 0:31:43\n\nThat makes sense. Yeah. And every company and every group need to be able to make that decision for themselves. There isn't a one unique, one size fits all.\n0:31:43 – 0:31:54\n\nRight. So, our core focus so far had been on product and development. But in terms of operations, have you been able to see that hey, JNAI is super helpful in terms of operations and this is how probably we have been able to leverage it to improve our operations.\n0:31:54 – 0:32:16\n\nYeah, number one is most operations are operational insights and operational details are sitting in people's heads.\n0:32:16 – 0:32:28\n\nBeing able to articulate it and write it all down is has always been an almost impossible task. But with JNAI, you're actually able to capture a lot of it and articulate it in a manner where the reliance on one person or one system or one position isn't that great anymore.\n0:32:28 – 0:32:51\n\nOkay, like earlier a code review or the operational insight look at it earlier the decision of what needs to be.\n0:32:51 – 0:33:03\n\nEarlier the decision of what responses to give for a hundred different scenarios typically needed some senior manager to be around, so that they could answer any escalated questions.\n0:33:03 – 0:33:18\n\nSo, you can absolutely replicate a human's insights with JNAI and make that go on the decision.\n0:33:18 – 0:33:31\n\nRight.\n0:33:31 – 0:33:34\n\nAnd if we boil this down to different segments like HR.\n0:33:34 – 0:33:41\n\nSo, HR you can totally hire somebody purely based on an AI interview, any AI remote screenings, any AI, you know, can absolutely be done with JNAI.\n0:33:41 – 0:33:56\n\nRight. And how successful, I mean, you have done a part of that yourself. How successful do you feel it is in terms, hey, it cannot be totally replaced.\n0:33:56 – 0:34:07\n\nBut yeah, I mean, if I have one person working on this, his efficiency does increase by 10x and he's still able to do it, but I still need one person. It's just not fully automated right now. Correct.\n0:34:07 – 0:34:19\n\nYeah. I mean, you have to be pragmatic about it. You keep pushing the boundaries of how much can be done by AI versus human. Like for example, I no longer have a marketing team because AI does a much better consistent job of, you know, doing all the social and marketing stuff.\n0:34:19 – 0:34:41\n\nThat's right.\n0:34:41 – 0:34:45\n\nAnd how effective is that generation? I mean, do we still need a human layer on top of it or is the generation good enough?\n0:34:45 – 0:34:55\n\nI say the generation is now pretty awesome.\n0:34:55 – 0:35:00\n\nBut it has required human's involvement and judgment. And there are small tees getting up to this point. But at this point, yeah, even involvement will not be good.\n0:35:00 – 0:35:12\n\nBecause Prachi had been trying to use some of the tools for her abridge market, but she was not able to cut through. So probably, I mean, I'll make her interact with one of the developers. Maybe she can talk to them and figure out what she's getting stuck at.\n0:35:12 – 0:35:27\n\nYeah, I think she started using Prism.\n0:35:27 – 0:35:29\n\nYeah, but she couldn't. She just got stuck. She said, Vicky, I tried, but I couldn't use anything out of it. So I was out.\n0:35:29 – 0:35:38\n\nBut I'm surprised because all the marketing teams are using tools like Prism right now.\n0:35:38 – 0:35:44\n\nI'll sit with her and I'll see what is there and then I'll probably get in touch with the team and see what can be done there.\n0:35:44 – 0:35:52\n\nAnd in terms of sales, where the relationship is very important, what do you feel? How is it going there?\n0:35:52 – 0:36:01\n\nParts of it are, yes, the glorified version of sales is all about relationships. But about 60% of sales work is grant work.\n0:36:01 – 0:36:14\n\nThat's true.\n0:36:14 – 0:36:15\n\nNot people relationships. About 40% of it, which takes it over the hump and gets the deal done, that is completely relationship based.\n0:36:15 – 0:36:23\n\nEven the 40% is a lot of consistency. A lot of consistency is required which gets a problem there.\n0:36:23 – 0:36:31\n\nYeah. So I'd say, you know, AI is content centering all of those stuff, even in sales.\n0:36:31 – 0:36:42\n\nGreat. Okay, that gives me most of the second section. Now, in your hindsight, what was the hardest hurdle or still is in implementing General Solutions?\n0:36:42 – 0:36:58\n\nI think just keeping up with all the development. I think it's the first time in the industry where we have a technology that evolves faster than we can actually consume it or even understand it completely.\n0:36:58 – 0:37:09\n\nThat's correct.\n0:37:09 – 0:37:10\n\nIf you just look at cloud computing, for example, it's the last big technology wave. Even today, 80% of enterprise workloads are still after starting the cloud.\n0:37:10 – 0:37:22\n\nAnd it's been, what, 20 years now almost?\n0:37:22 – 0:37:24\n\nYes.\n0:37:24 – 0:37:25\n\n2007 was when, 2006 was when AWS started, so it's almost 20 years.\n0:37:25 – 0:37:30\n\nBut in 20 years, our market share of capturing mind share has been about 20%.\n0:37:30 – 0:37:39\n\nHowever, everybody is doing something or the other in AI today.\n0:37:39 – 0:37:43\n\nThat's true.\n0:37:43 – 0:37:44\n\nCan the school know what JAD GPT is and how to use AI to do their homework and so on?\n0:37:44 – 0:37:50\n\nSo I think you've never seen this level of AI adoption use and fascination in the history of technology.\n0:37:50 – 0:38:00\n\nAnd so keeping up with the million different updates that are happening across the globe on things that are AI related is just incredibly hard.\n0:38:00 – 0:38:10\n\nSo everything is transient at the moment. Your best practices, the kind of solutions that have been thought out, the modalities that have been thought out, they are all transient.\n0:38:10 – 0:38:21\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:38:21 – 0:38:22\n\nAnd so we will have to wait and see how it evolves further.\n0:38:22 – 0:38:26\n\nYeah, and more specifically, like nothing, no technology, no idea, no, nothing has like spread this, it's like wildfire right now.\n0:38:26 – 0:38:36\n\nCorrect.\n0:38:36 – 0:38:38\n\nWhat has been your biggest revelation or learning while implementing JAN AI in your organization?\n0:38:38 – 0:38:45\n\nAnd I mean, I am really, really wanting to hear about the non-tech part of it today because I know that's probably what you're going to share.\n0:38:45 – 0:38:53\n\nI think the biggest revelation for me is that I don't think of AI as replacing a person's job or replacing human work.\n0:38:53 – 0:39:12\n\nI see AI as something that can enhance it and here is an example. So teachers, what would you say is the role of a teacher?\n0:39:12 – 0:39:27\n\nThe teacher's role is to basically guide the student and let the student understand or learn on his own basically, give the path, show the direction.\n0:39:27 – 0:39:36\n\nWhat do you think the teacher does for 97% of the time?\n0:39:36 – 0:39:42\n\nI think 97% of the time they are trying to balance between how each student would probably try to understand things in a different way or I mean, try to understand every student's different perspective because for the teacher it's very difficult.\n0:39:42 – 0:39:56\n\nThey cannot, I mean, they cannot have one point of view and teach every kid.\n0:39:56 – 0:40:01\n\nThat is a utopian thought. In reality, 97% of our teachers' time is spent either in front of a classroom delivering a lecture about some content or collecting papers.\n0:40:01 – 0:40:22\n\nWhich means that they are only able to spend about 3% of their time actually knowing the student, understanding what they got, what they didn't get, understanding what the capabilities of a student are, what their interests are and so on.\n0:40:22 – 0:40:40\n\nThat's only 3%. So what you said was the role of a teacher, they are only getting to spend 3% on it.\n0:40:40 – 0:40:48\n\nSo with AI for the first time you are able to actually let the kid be taught content in a very personalized manner and the teacher on the other hand can then focus on what is a life skill, what are the gaps and how do they need to kind of overcome them and doing coaching.\n0:40:48 – 0:41:10\n\nBut practically speaking Rahul, still on ground, teachers are far from having proper evaluations or proper teaching mechanisms or even proper tracking mechanisms.\n0:41:10 – 0:41:23\n\nYeah, you should check out this website called Two Hour Learning. If you look at that, that's a great example of where it's actually 3-1-2-1. I'm doing this with my own kids and yeah, it works.\n0:41:23 – 0:41:47\n\nOkay. It actually works. So for me, AI enhances human capabilities. Done the right way, AI enhances human capabilities and done the wrong way, I mean it can be all over the place.\n0:41:47 – 0:42:04\n\nThat's true, that's true and I mean so far it's not reached the masses yet but I mean if this is played out right, it can really help out. I totally agree on that.\n0:42:04 – 0:42:14\n\nYeah, I actually think it's already reached the masses. I think it's wrong because AI has reached the masses.\n0:42:14 – 0:42:18\n\nNo, most of the teachers are still in...\n0:42:18 – 0:42:21\n\nNo, I'm not saying for teaching. AI has reached the masses.\n0:42:21 – 0:42:26\n\nYeah, AI has reached the masses. I was talking about teaching, the teaching aspect of it.\n0:42:26 – 0:42:30\n\nYeah, teaching because we have not thought enough about what's the use case.\n0:42:30 – 0:42:34\n\nThat's correct. Like how many people hold the opinion that books are now obsolete but there are people that it would just come as some sort of massive shock.\n0:42:34 – 0:42:49\n\nYeah and even on that aspect, I would really question on how much of the knowledge that is being taught is actually required anymore because of the LLMs.\n0:42:49 – 0:43:00\n\nSo I think there is a very specific need to rethink the curriculum and what exactly should be offloaded and what should be the focus where a child, a human child should actually...\n0:43:00 – 0:43:11\n\nI mean what should he focus on? Not everything is required anymore.\n0:43:11 – 0:43:17\n\nTrue. Like I said, knowledge is kind of free and out there, right? The LLM knows most of it so you shouldn't have to do any of that research. However, building foundations is still very important.\n0:43:17 – 0:43:35\n\nAbsolutely and I think that should be a cool feature.\n0:43:35 – 0:43:37\n\nThe foundations give you confidence but again AI can teach you all of that stuff. You don't need a teacher-teacher to teach you that.\n0:43:37 – 0:43:45\n\nRight. Rahul, if you can turn back one year and you have seen GenAI more than a lot of people in this world, what would you do differently one year earlier?\n0:43:45 – 0:43:59\n\nThat's an interesting question. So I would say a year ago, I wasn't quite as prepared for the sheer firehose of AI announcements.\n0:43:59 – 0:44:21\n\nAnd because it was so new everywhere, it wasn't like there were any well-defined paths that, you know, general AI has got to take across different...\n0:44:21 – 0:44:36\n\nSorry, I lost my chain of thought to me one second. I think this one was a better prepared for the firehose of AI announcements.\n0:44:36 – 0:44:53\n\nI think I ended up making what I'm happy with today but it could only have gone the other way. It was a time early on where you had to make a decision about whether you believe that LLM would get significantly better with larger context and better capabilities,\n0:44:53 – 0:45:18\n\nreasoning capabilities, or build, start fine-tuning and building custom models. Those are two different bends that you would make for yourself, right?\n0:45:18 – 0:45:28\n\nWe at first went with a bend where LLM will get faster, better, cheaper over a period of time and so it was...\n0:45:28 – 0:45:39\n\nI would say it could have gone either way back then and I'd say there's no two ways about it but that could have gone the other way.\n0:45:39 – 0:45:49\n\nAnd yeah, I wish there was a better way to capture all those silos of knowledge to understand exactly where this technology was heading.\n0:45:49 – 0:46:02\n\nSo if you would probably know what you know today and you have a chance of going back one year, you would probably create a tool to capture that particular knowledge or use it in a different way or what?\n0:46:02 – 0:46:16\n\nSo let's have a dedicated team to start way more experimentation than we ever did.\n0:46:16 – 0:46:22\n\nGot it. Got it. Got it. And my last question, Rahul, it's a cliché question. What would be your recommendation for companies looking to achieve digital transformation through generative AI?\n0:46:22 – 0:46:39\n\nLet's say having every operation and every team run their own set of experiments where they're trying to evaluate how generative AI can be used by their groups because if you're not doing that, you're not innovating.\n0:46:39 – 0:46:52\n\nIf you're not innovating, you will be obsolete faster than you realize.\n0:46:52 – 0:46:58\n\nThat's right. Thank you, Rahul. I went a bit above this. Thank you. Thank you so much. I know you're traveling and all.\n0:46:58 – 0:47:07\n\nRahul, is it possible for you to recommend at least three more people who can actually have this interview with me?\n0:47:07 – 0:47:17\n\nThat will be great, Rahul. Thank you so much. You have a great talk. Have fun. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n0:47:17 – 0:47:27",

It's a coffee time. is the idea? What is the idea?\n\n@0:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you for watching! I think I think that's do I think the way to do it, I way did it.\nIt's not that much. It's the way the way to do it. That's the way I don't for Our PhD is the study of the study.\nThe study of the study of the study is called if the study is here, let's connect two professors in some way.\nstudy of the study is called the study of the study. So for example, each faculty who have trained PhD can be active.\nThey can have educational qualification, more use of their It's not there, but it's the bare minimum. But it's not extraordinary, you could put everybody in the car, right?\nSo, I think I have a professor in the UK, I think it's big He's help us, and I think Yes.\nthink he's a good professor. think he's good 3-P-S-D-X-I-C. He's a great researcher. I think he's good We'd to do I he's a good person.\n\n@2:28 - Jagbir Singh\nI think a good teacher.\n\n@2:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ncan't that. He's not graph here. It's not easy. It really requires a lot of time effort a lot of things.\nBut he's a good teacher. He's great teacher. It's a good teacher. But in reality, on the ground. What is the status of the area?\nGenerally, when I try Kiai, how successful it is for them, where it has been successful, and if it has not been successful, then what areas do you feel it has not been successful?\nAnd this will be basically covered in two parts, will be hard facts in terms of tangibly cab benefit, and the other aspects will be in terms of what is the opinion, what is your opinion in certain aspects.\nSo, I will put forward some questions, and then we will take it from there, there is some question. Take it.\n\n@3:37 - Jagbir Singh\nSure. Perfect.\n\n@3:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, Kiai, to categorize this in the right spot in the whole, what industry and sector are you representing right now?\n\n@3:49 - Jagbir Singh\nWe are operating in logistic and transporation sector. Okay.\n\n@3:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLogistic and transporation, and in terms of I mean what number of employees and revenue generally and at any point in time there are two ways you can either say I don't want to share or you can say my shares are out but do not quote it.\n\n@4:13 - Jagbir Singh\nCompany we can categorize as a mid-size startup company operating since 2015.\n\n@4:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRevenue is something I do not want to are around 600 600 and is this is this publicly listed to again see the numbers online which has a it's not publicly listed not listed but the around you might be able to download the statement from Ministry of Finance MOF site.\nCoinc benchmark which a rough benchmark that I can categorize it in let's say 10 and 50 million or this stuff benchmark.\nSo, now let us get into a few more facts into understanding R V. before I get into here since many many years right, but AI can that there is smaller bubble called machine learning right.\nMachine learning can that is a smaller bubble called deep learning and deep learning can under be there a smaller bubble called gen AI.\nare actually with a chat GPT a ways it is coming up right. So, our focus of this interview would be specifically on gen AI not on the larger aspect of other\nAI that we have been using for many years right and has been beneficial for us so what do you see is the AI adoption right now internally for your own purpose and externally for customers as well both ways so first of all there is a lot of chatter around AI these days a lot of people you know expect companies to adopt and do pivot on jnai as fast as possible expecting kind of a breakthrough of their productivity output and whatnot using that right so a lot of this is i would categorize as a gas which means it's getting out of proportion to a certain extent but having said that there are some real implementations because end of the day it's a niche you know technology breakthrough i would say and it is in the path to\n\n@7:00 - Jagbir Singh\nwho revolutionize some of the aspects of you know things we are doing. From our context or maybe similar company of oversize start of the the way we operate.\nThere are different different milestones for different different you know stages where we started thinking about integrating JNI and how it is going to accelerate whatever we are doing right now.\nWe are not expecting that it is going to put us in front of our value chain instead of that it's like you know having a very smart assistant, smart and over-owned assistant I would say which is going to present a lot of you know vague information, hallucinate a lot and we have to close we have to you know close the observation need to put in close the observation so before accepting whatever is recommended.\nOkay, having said that the journey has been already started and it's been kind of a successful journey I would say whatever the expected we are gaining out of it.\nThe first thing we started is as usual because it's a SaaS product company in logistic and transportation. So we are developing a lot of modules as a part of, you know, product shoot with the oldest transport management system.\nSo the first use of JNI which we proposed is to help our developer to increase the productivity in terms of providing them for the assistant AI editor.\nAnd there we did lot of testing, lot of two C's around available code editors and we We figured it out that the productivity has done almost in line of 30% or so because first people were very quick to adopt the way Genia is helping them and second Genia was kind of smart enough to provide the relevant support to our developers to accelerate their coding practices.\nAnother aspect is like you know building small test cases which usually takes lot of time of developer once their main you know coding is done right in angelery activities I would say that would speed up like anything and a couple of cases are also there where Genia and with the help of Genia entire feature go to build in less than couple of years couple of years are so definitive improvement in terms of\nacceleration of software development, I would say, realizing and to a certain extent we have already realized.\n\n@10:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, that's great.\n\n@10:13 - Jagbir Singh\nWhat else? Next page is basically putting this code in the production through CICD pipeline. Here a couple of use cases are built in the pipeline where we are thinking to how the JNIO, let's say, LLM level, we can improve the process.\nOne thing is around doing the static and dynamic security testing before putting the code into the production. A couple of tools are there, which is something we are really waiting.\nI won't say we are at the stage where this will be integrated fully to realize the process. potential but this is the direction we are heading for.\nOur stage would be once the mode is in production then of course as a backend let us say cloud engineering team we also need to put forward a predictive monitoring in place because the health of applications in process and we want to have a stage where we would like to predict which services are prone to failures.\nThese policies are having an imminent possibility of disruption that is again something we would like to pivot with LLMs or machine learning because lot of data is there lot of logs are getting generated.\nRight now of course it is only more possible to analyze those logs with present tools. We have to do such prediction, we are relying on a little bit with AI, how we can do that.\nThat is another stage. Of course, in a micro level, we also would like to trend, what is the trend of alerting, where the noise is, how we can reduce it, and the secondary thing is, once the incident is there, how fast we can rise the incident, how fast we can debug and figure it out the use of the incident, so we can get it and also figure it out the action item so that we can get it permanently.\nThose are the use cases, definitely use cases I would say, which we have categorized as a potential object to attack AI and how, I mean, I don't know what is on, but what is going on.\nSo, I am expecting the way engineers are spending their time. You are able to reduce the time by 20, percent.\nWe will say it as a success, full metrics, start with it. That's kind of great.\n\n@13:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYep. Another one.\n\n@13:20 - Jagbir Singh\nWhich is something which is happening behind the scene. Now, coming to the front.\n\n@13:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet's understand, typically, business, convection or workload over the existing company.\n\n@13:37 - Jagbir Singh\nIf you are tracking a parcel or tracking a consignment, you start your consignment on source and you have to track it till the time it reaches to the destination.\n\n@13:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat journey over the trip can be of few hours to couple of hours also.\n\n@13:57 - Jagbir Singh\nRight? Click your button. The consignment started on Mumbai and it has to be delivered to let's say Delhi, it will take a couple of days.\nWe have a capability which we call as track and trace where we track that let's say vehicle. Precisely using multiple mechanisms in place.\nOne of the mechanism is deep GPS device if the vehicle is equipped with more and more vehicles are nowadays equipped with GPS devices either internally through embedded GPS source.\nExplanability is a separate device. That is not available. We also have a capability to track the scene of the driver so that we will get to know the location once the consent is there.\nThat is also not available or as a supplementary we also have a capability to track let's say fast track charges which is vehicle process.\nAnd on top of it we have a driver. application also which we can install in drivers phone if you are sharing a smartphone.\nSo with all of these capabilities we have a really good coverage in terms of tracking the vehicle movement.\n\n@15:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow once you have such huge data pointers because for some of the vehicles we are able to track with a frequency of 30 seconds in certain, the frequency is like a 0.5.\n\n@15:38 - Jagbir Singh\nSo end of the day considering a 5 minute frequency if you have good calculation we can receive hundreds thousands of things more at which complete a couple of things.\nAnd then you can start reading certain logics on top of this data because therefore, is moving and then it will be deemed normal but just in case if there is a ping and the location is not changing then definitely you would like to add custom logic to categorize this anomaly as a you know stop page and some event could have happened during this topic.\nIt could refueling up the vehicle it would be right now taking a break right for lunch dinner sleep whatever you can do but there are you know kinds of possibilities why such a long break to happen.\nNow again if you are conducting thousands of trips a day how then of trips are sending thousands of things to you add countries the large amount of data to analyze right and every single time there is a delay except there is a threshold with the weakly scattered\nmore than let's say half an hour more than arms are it can be held out but it's really difficult to analyze what could be the possibility right again for a particular lane let's say Mumbai to that means a busier lane and considering thousands of trips are happening on each day we would be getting a data historical data which should be enough to do lot of predictions what is the possibility of calculating a really good ETA for particular trip which is which is getting scheduled right what is the possibility of getting introduced a delay of the ongoing trip to come back to this historical data we have what sort of what is the possibility of a long all long stop is for a particular trip so that the dashboard\ncompanies, the consigners have better visibility around that way. If you go to PL, it is a news case, I believe which can definitely elevate the experience of our customers, provide a lot of value to them.\n\n@18:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwe can bring out that sort of visibility, we are trying to, let us say, do a lot of you see that.\nGreat. In this, I mean, thank you for the entire journey. In this journey, why do you think Jennie Airfits?\nWhat kind of lock does it unlock in this journey? The particular use case, I just described. Yeah, the entire journey.\n\n@18:54 - Jagbir Singh\nThis particular use case, From the source of the lesson.\n\n@19:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou should get it.\n\n@19:01 - Jagbir Singh\nSo, I think in that way, every vehicle owner, every, let's say, transporter, every customer, wants to have more and more in terms of what is the commitment I can make to the customer, that why when the vehicle is going to deliver that value, that package.\nNow, we can say that, hey, owner and average, this trip will take four days or we can say why this trip usually take four days, but there is a, you know, 50% probability that it might get stuck because of these, these things.\nI understand that segment.\n\n@19:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is, genii, the specific genii, how do we, how do we figure it into this?\nWhat part of this entire thing do you think is, are one of the focus? Yeah, yeah, but it can give some good action or benefits.\nSo, see, sorry, it might not also, whether possibly it might not.\n\n@20:12 - Jagbir Singh\nWhat I am thinking is at the back end, this predictive engine will provide more visibility. Second is, on top of it, we can expose an interface to our customers, they can do some analytical queries, okay, by when I'm going to get my package, let's say, and instead of a static response, it could be dynamic response in terms of, you know, after analyzing all the data pointers, you would be getting your package by this time.\n\n@20:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, it would be an L1 support to be very precise on that, it can be an L1 support where I have data, I have somebody asking me a query, I can take the data and give them the answer.\nYou know, in a natural language, right, that's one of the possibility, while it will end.\n\n@21:00 - Jagbir Singh\nrich, the underling algorithm we have deployed to bring out more sort of visibility to assess the right.\n\n@21:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPerfect, that's a great use case in terms of this and a very valid one for Janae. But this is one journey that you have.\nmean is there any other journey in this that probably benefits out of and this is again external but there would be HR, there will be I mean your people management there will be things like let us say the kind of data that you are sharing or not sharing right.\nHow do you how do you put Janae in other aspects of or other departments of your organization?\n\n@21:45 - Jagbir Singh\nOkay I feel we are at the state where everybody is willing to do but but let's say considering this marketing, considering HR co-ops, considering other similar admin ops.\nI don't see use case as of now because at this size, at this movement, there is not, these are not a big sort of let's say challenge for us, right.\nSo, any investment just out of curiosity or out, just to follow the trend would be an over investment for me.\nWhat I'm understanding is that even though the software tools which we have deployed for these any particular function, let's say HR, might be exposing certain capability through their JNI plugin funded as enterprise version or so, we are not interested.\nreally don't Absolutely.\n\n@23:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere should be always a lock that you can unlock with this key, because if is no other thing at the key and saying here, let me search for a lock that I can unlock, right?\n\n@23:09 - Jagbir Singh\nSo we don't want to carry a hammer and we are just looking for that. Yeah. They have to hit on it, right?\nAbsolutely. So we don't see any potential benefit in lot of areas which we operate internally. Right. We are the disproportionate value can be created by here.\n\n@23:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is a great thing, because I would love to understand in your head, what areas do you think benefit and what areas do you think do not benefit?\nYeah.\n\n@23:42 - Jagbir Singh\nThis will be a very generic statement. don't want to go into this area, it will not be anything.\n\n@23:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet me get a bit more specific for you to make it easier. In popular terms, genii is generally being used for number one.\n10 generation, number two, logic or brainstorming or research and number three for communication. These are the main three areas it's touching and it's it's setting out, it is there, right?\nSo brainstorming, logic in looking at data, communicating with people or generating content, whether it be marketing content, images, or course, right?\nSo these are three in areas where it's focusing on. Now with these three things, are there certain things that really do not matter in your line of business or your focus areas or some that might really affect?\n\n@24:40 - Jagbir Singh\nWell, I'm still not getting the entire context, but but the whole idea is it also depends on which, you know, sector you are operating in.\nAbsolutely, in your sector and and and the way you are operating it. Let's say at the juncture of a B2B company, we are not having\nmarketing.\n\n@25:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe don't want to do that, right?\n\n@25:03 - Jagbir Singh\nThere is no use case because under definition makes sense in this case.\n\n@25:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n@25:09 - Jagbir Singh\nSecond is on content generation is again very limited. We don't want to do a lot of publishing in terms of research papers, how we are going to label nice that logistic space and everything.\nThat that's again something which is which which have a very limited sort of adoption. The idea is to accelerate a process.\nThe idea is to create value out of something which you are already doing which you understand. Correct. One of those dishes.\nFor a marketing company, I am already doing marketing.\n\n@25:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have a lot of data.\n\n@25:49 - Jagbir Singh\nAI is going to create more and I am doing. That's what my perspective is. Now considering these things because the primary area for us is to 1 increase productivity because that is neutral.\n\n@26:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhatever you are doing, if can increase your productivity, it's going to help you in all of the ways.\n\n@26:24 - Jagbir Singh\nSecond is to create more value for your customers. Now these two are the diving motivations. Hey, can we do something in these two areas?\nHow we can increase our productivity? might not directly translate into let's say value for customers. It would be let's say making us better in different different areas, different different let's say we are doing.\nAnd second is whatever data, whatever processes, whatever understanding we have of our business. of our sector or for processes, how we can create more value out of it for our customers, right?\nSo, that's how I look at it.\n\n@27:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, that's internal and external benefits that you look at. Internal and external benefits.\n\n@27:14 - Jagbir Singh\nAnd then of course, it depends on what is the exact, you know, sector you are operating in, what is something specifically you are doing, you are doing market meters, are doing user research, B2C company, all of those, then definitely a lot of things will be visible, lot of things won't be visible, but here at our end, lot of things which means how to do under the hood, right?\nYou know, I mean, this doesn't warrant to be exposed to probably in a different way. Right.\n\n@27:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, let me now boil down to all the data that are connected and a few questions on that. will be use it and they were able to improve their work.\nquite 30%, right? That's what I understood. Is that something that is, mean, did you have a tangible way of measuring that 30% or is it an assumption or how did you come to the 30%.\n\n@28:20 - Jagbir Singh\nWell, I don't think it is a very scientific way of measuring it. It is more on the output which are saying compared to what we were estimated earlier.\nLet's say for any new product for any new module. Usually the senior engineers are very good architects or very good at projecting here.\nis, you know, count of days, then days we will be taking that to develop this particular lesson module. Again, any engineer, once the task is getting assigned, they are good at predicting\nend of this week, I would be able to deliver this task. Now, if you just, I forget those tasks in, in Mondays or in, you know, different, different, let's say, in etc.\nSo, in GMS are able to see, whatever they were able to deliver or code for a day, they are able to do the same coding, same output by halfway and by infinity.\n\n@29:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf I try to shorten this, what you are trying to say is that, hey, I was earlier using x time, using y time, y time is less than x time.\nSo, that is a saving for me in 30 percent, right?\n\n@29:41 - Jagbir Singh\nYes, that's one way. Second is, of course, the coverage in terms of, there are couple of other activities, just give me a little\nSo, it depends on the time.\n\n@30:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, time is one aspect, but there are certain places where I have noticed that, hey, we were able to do it in less time, but there were more errors introduced, right?\nSo, the quality also balances along with time and so, Sometimes what happens is, hey, I was able to deliver in a week, but there were issues which were introduced, and now I have to go back and fix them, right, or the other thing that has been introduced.\nHave you noticed something like that, or how has your experience been? Everybody has a different experience.\n\n@31:15 - Jagbir Singh\nAbsolutely. Now, in this journey, what path our developers took, is slightly different, they would say, rather than jumping on the train, and sometimes that entire, let's say, module or feature needs to be built by these tools.\nInstead of that day, they are kind of, let's say, helping in building that section or small, small pieces, where I, as a developer, exactly, you know, this is something needs to be written, and it can be, you know, auto-completed by AI editor.\nI can quickly check, yeah, this is something which looks good. So that possibility of debugging, I mean, putting down a lot of time on debugging, which,\ndetect that time you saved during the development reduces a bit right. So our idea is that I was going to fold this section and it usually took take me two hours for this piece of code.\nBut with AI it just took me one and a half hour with the same quality because I can understand with the clustering loop.\nSo I saved my half an hour time on this one without impacting the quality. Why? Because the development is so modular that it's you know in general it's difficult to build a bulk of module which can become fatal once you deploy it in your production and figure it out here.\nThe error rate has increased though the quality of the code has deteriorated compared to what we used to do manually.\nSo that's a step-by-step let's adoption we have a clear mandate that we do not we should not hurry because as I already mentioned how we categorized AI assistant is like an over constant assistant who is just throughout even you know things which we haven't requested yet right just because it might have lot of you know things to say the idea is to take smaller smaller steps your confidence on it train it with the larger context and over a period of time even the quality will automatically increase to certain extent right so to answer your question we haven't seen although there will be some impact I don't know the quantum but we haven't seen any significant impact on quality we can we can easily save that since the quality has not been impacted my ROI is about 30% more\n\n@34:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbecause you are you are you are putting a cost also so your developers are churning out 30% more but you are putting in a cost for that EI as well so your ROI will be something like 30% minus the cost and there will be some number where you will reach that via return level and rest cost is negative cost is negligible it's you know that cursor or chat GPT is just 20 dollar a month and mostly that planning sufficient okay got it okay so ROI we are getting the cost is quite quite negligible and we are using the same tool for case test cases reports etc the same same tool is working for us on that also but yeah now the other side of things is proprietary data or proprietary methods going out to the LLM and the world are there any data policies that we are trying to put\nforward so that we do not lose any proprietary data out. Are there any mechanisms that you're trying to push to people using this or everything that hey I don't really care because it's not touching my proprietary data it's only cool right I don't really care.\n\n@35:19 - Jagbir Singh\nI think I would align to this thought process that as of now we are not caring that much. I believe there is a privacy mode which can instruct the AI to not look at our zip code and do not let's just think outside my machine but at the juncture I don't see any problem as such I mean it is helping us to train it better to have more context and in in tune in return we will be having more ROI in terms of quality of output from it that type of concept\nOne is bearing our mind, but it is not something which is fine. It's concrete, really. Yes, yes. So we are aware that at some point we have to think about it, what is happening, what should not happen, how it should happen and all of those questions.\nRight now it looks like an initial adoption of cutting is technology, we believe that it's not up to the mark.\nAnd then there could be shortcomings, everybody is aware about the shortcomings, they are extra careful to not deploy that code and not let's say propagate or expose all of the repositories at once.\nSo these bits and pieces, we do believe that we have certain mechanisms in place, but overall that broader level concern is not there yet.\n\n@36:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, there is another concern in terms of as a company pushing in deploys to use January another three major categories that over my interviews I've seen right and they have many in between also on one side we have companies which say because I don't really care but I really want you to use January because if you're not using it right we are losing out because that's that's the position right now on the other end we have companies who say I do not want you to use January I because if you use January I the kind of output that I'm getting is not the kind of output I'm looking at right and in between these companies who are probably like I really don't care whether you use January I or not as long as you're meeting my standard okay I mean this thing at this quality in this time right I don't care whether you use January I or not right go ahead you use it or not and then again they have companies in between both all of all these spectrum right where do you place yourself I mean do you really care you don't care you want to push\nHow is it for you?\n\n@38:03 - Jagbir Singh\nSo, it is like we would put ourselves in the middle where we don't want to put it down their throat that they have to use it.\nBut it's like on the motivating the team. Hey, something is there which is sort of a liberal and a lot of new things are coming in, new capabilities are there.\nThere is enough evidence that it is enhancing productivity. Now we all need to grow, we all need to and if we all are growing as a group then the company will be out from the faster growth path.\nSo, I will try it out. This is the Market Benchmark where we are seeing the reports that anywhere from 10 to 90 percent.\nproductivity increase has been seen right but that's entirely dependent on how you are going to use it, how much you are comfortable, what sort of compatibility you have, what sort of you know integration you want to do with it but the idea is that we should not be ignorant about it idea is that as a you know division growth for a path also even if you don't want to use it in in the professional like a task you are doing but at individual level you should be aware about if this is something which is coming as a tsunami.\n\n@39:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAs an employee let us say if I come up and tell you hey I mean I am aware of it I know what is moving I can tell you the latest things that are moving but I don't want to use it I don't want to use it because I feel I am better I can do it faster is that is that okay answer?\n\n@39:51 - Jagbir Singh\nThat's an okay answer but I would like to know what it means by I don't want to use it because I I\nwould be curious to know their reasoning. I think I can pull faster.\n\n@40:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nkind of suggestions it gives me, I mean, I might have errors, I can do faster. That's one very common thing I heard from developers, Senior developers especially, not the junior ones, ones are very happy.\nSenior ones might say, mean, it'll take me a long, this is quicker, I can do it better, my logic is better.\nAnd that happens a few times.\n\n@40:23 - Jagbir Singh\nBut that happens a few times, on the side, I also want to, let's say understand a bit more, that are you really working on a complex problem?\nA complex problem. I mean, these are the biases towards my use curve. Are you correct? think there's something wrong.\nI want to do the data. I want to be have an objective, let's say rather than subjectively, mirror code, nay, select.\nhave to go up to my password code. I want to see a data key. have used it. And because of this and this reason, I don't want to use it.\nAnd that becomes a different problem to solve for it.\n\n@41:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, is great because the bias is towards use curve. That's bias, right?\n\n@41:05 - Jagbir Singh\nPerfect, perfect.\n\n@41:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd now, I mean, I'll just get to some opinion questions. and before the opinion question, I'm sorry, I missed one.\ndid you feel he used gen AI, but it was not worth it. I mean, I tried it out. We did different use cases.\nWe did put in effort, but the kind of results that I'm getting is not worth it, not there yet.\nAnd it is okay to see that, that's fine.\n\n@41:32 - Jagbir Singh\nBut partially this reducing alert noise, analyzing the alerts are something which we intuitively know. So, there is not kind of ground breaking inside, are getting out of it.\nSo, expectation was that it going to condense that, let's say overall output, it's going to give us a lot of insight.\ntight, actionable inside. But instead of that, there are the normal trend showing, normal graph showing. It's not insightful. That's the answer, got a formula of different companies.\n\n@42:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt is not bringing out something new, just saying it.\n\n@42:13 - Jagbir Singh\nWhat is this? Oh, oh, Sabiaki, let's see, if I spent a couple of hours, I would be able to build that, right?\nIt's not something that I'm, you know, saying he cutting his technology on the use, he's special Okay, got it.\n\n@42:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's a great answer. So now, hindsight questions, what has been the hardest hurdle to implement JNI in the organization?\nSome of them have been probably talking about people, some of them have been talking about technology, so, being expensive, right?\nmany different answers I've got. What's your biggest hurdle that your face got?\n\n@42:51 - Jagbir Singh\nI won't say the biggest, but a very new type of hurdle you are going to let's say no. We want to give them money and they are not accessing it.\nSo anyway, the idea is again to adoption. The way software developers have adopted it. The way software developers are curious to find out, you know, experiment with it.\nWe are not seeing that type of curiosity, are not seeing that type of adoption, we are not seeing that type of let's say out of box request from other functions, other players.\nSo that essentially putting us in a situation we want, we don't want to push, let's say you have to use it and on the same side we also don't know whether we are actually using it or not.\nLot of people in organization, not only our organization, our growth organization have a personal subscription to chat GPT to other tools but the idea is that are we seeing a tangible increase in output or quality in output where we can you know put for we have coffee, let us say productivity increase the cry the answering move right.\nSo outside let us say tech community it's difficult to you know push people to start using it in a tangible way not not just it's becoming more of a shadow ID basically rewriting your mails and contact or mails of the chat GPT email right.\n\n@44:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm already at time we only have 10 more minutes but I have a few more questions left out. Yeah my next meeting is at 5 so\nSo, next question on this is, whatever area you have used, what is the most notable success and how do you measure that success?\n\n@45:15 - Jagbir Singh\nYeah, notable success is this software development acceleration. This is the single most notable product and wow moment for us from day one itself.\nWe did not expect this type of adoption will be there, that is one. Second, we did not expect this type of ROI will be there.\nWhat we expected is that it will take a lot of time for people to adopt it and second it will take a lot of time for the tool also to get trained the way we are doing the development.\nBut honestly, it is like, yeah, it has been. This is like a really good use of AI. Yes, it's not sound of the box.\nYes, work out of the box. Right.\n\n@46:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd with all this, what's your biggest revelation so far? What do you think about this was, this is what I suddenly, I mean, understood all.\nThis is what my revelation was using Gini IT. Are they? Are they what?\n\n@46:22 - Jagbir Singh\nAre they what? But so the first thing first we did is to give you more subscription of cursor for our developers without having expectation of let's say output.\nI mean, it was most most around the curiosity developers had and we had, we have to start implementation, we have to start adoption from somewhere and software devs are the first place.\nRight. But but the moment initially we started noticing that there is a considerable increase in output, considerable increase in productivity.\nI, myself, got interested to know more around how the health works, actually. Right. So, when I did the deep dive in terms of how, you know, token works in terms of how the pretend training works in terms of how actually Jenny I works.\n\n@47:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, this, with this current knowledge that you have, right, with this revelation, with this understanding, with everything, if you now are allowed to go one year back, what would you do different you?\nOkay.\n\n@47:53 - Jagbir Singh\nI think I will start to follow product projects in parallel rather than starting. sequentially. So what we started is like, you know, let's integrate with software development practices and wait for the output.\nThen we started let's, let's execute our DevOps engineers to integrate with our pipeline and let's wait for output. Instead of that, it should be like a general tool which is available for everybody and not necessarily each one of us, but at least you know, one kind of let's say person from each function, each group, each team should start evaluating it.\nSo that that parallel adoption across the teams, across the functions is something I would like to do if I can start with it.\n\n@48:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is interesting. This is the second time I'm hearing this and the first time was from the city of a multi-billion dollar company in the same me.\nOkay, so yeah, nice and. Last question and this would be a bit more cliché right, that if you have to give advice to somebody who is now getting on the Janaei bandwagon in order to do their distal transformation or betterment, what is your advice do and both?\n\n@49:20 - Jagbir Singh\nMy advice would be first of all let's know take it very lightly because the way people start initially is like a side product is that they are already doing 100 of things, this becomes 100 and 1.\nInstead of that it should be taken with a conscious that hey this is something big and we need to major it.\nFirst of all major it, second is start adoption, start integration in parallel in a lot of different different areas because you got no which area you will hit jackpot first, yes.\nBecause that would be like some hidden trials, but again, the whole idea is that with those hidden trials, you will be getting a lot of context, lot of, I would say, NOLAS, which you can apply into different areas, in different function also, in different kind of you know, conversation also, the one area which I believe is happening or one thing which I believe is happening a lot of talk around this HNAI, which is just a putting wrapper over chat, GBT, co-pilot and all of those.\nIt looks good on your people tree, on your website, on your marketing material, but there is no substance around it, right?\nYou don't have any data to back that claim, you don't have any really good to say, okay, this is something we have done.\nI would say, it's becoming a really crowded space. Any company which is going to pitch me that we are gen AI native, are gen AI gantar.\nWe've been a couple of questions, I won't be able to go on whether they are real or they are just you know.\nSo this is something we should avoid instead of that, start it at the level, root level, wherever you have data, where you have a very solid use case, right?\nlet's start majoring.\n\n@51:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's awesome, thank you so much.\n\n@51:37 - Jagbir Singh\nYou can see 7 minutes, 7-8 minutes and how's your experience? What are some of the revelations you've got with your interviews?\nYeah, I've been working with you for the first.\n\n@51:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI should be getting into two parts, then we'll take a parallel part, my own work in because I have been working in gen AI for the last four years roughly.\nI started right in the beginning. Japji PD-3, have observed no issue together. I have been into deep research with Gen AI.\nI have been working a lot with it, right? With the tune that we have actually generated products when people were not knowing about what Gen AI is, right?\nso that which potentially is RA and so on. that's that's there. Second part is this interviews that I'm having with so many people.\nAnd I mean, it's giving a very different view of how things are, right? So I'll start with the interviews first, interviews to my wife is all over the place, right?\nEverybody is, when I start, they are all excited to keep different because a lot of difference. Like in the tangible benefit of account, it's like, I know, don't know, I don't don't know.\n\n@52:45 - Jagbir Singh\nThat's right. is that percentage if I put forward in the data point of view?\n\n@52:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo data point of view, there have been companies on two different sides of things. One side of things, companies which are actively\nand very forcibly pushing this across, they have quoted me 10X defense, which is humorous, right? And they have been able to substitute for data, 10X.\n\n@53:09 - Jagbir Singh\nSorry? Do you really believe that 10X is really cool?\n\n@53:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nfield of work alone, for example, it comes to me as a company, a proposal is it is not a proposal.\nThey can have more proposal to bring us more data, and it's available as a push-air, that proposal comes out much faster in a matter of hours instead of days, which is 10X.\n\n@53:34 - Jagbir Singh\nThey can't come to their use case.\n\n@53:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAgain, I have been covering companies from three revenue to a $100 billion company, right? So it can beach my head, right?\none side is this 10X difference, which they are getting, actually getting, right? And the other side is companies who are not sure of the ROI, when we talk about ROI, are trading very carefully, but they are still able to go.\nof that yes we can see benefits right in that you know of let's say 30 percent 40 percent 50 percent which we can tangibly see but other than that we are able to see benefits but we are not able to tangibly say anything about it so these are two different aspects two different kinds of companies one very aggressively into it the other trending very carefully and very passively and there's one whole lot they say but you just need an army that's right i have i have seen but i'm not able to get benefits that is because they were only half-heartedly touching them they still know they still feel more difference about benefit but they still not now from my experience and this is coming from co-genier research we have been able to turn out tools like direct student mentorship like bachego match me is our layer\nHe says, OK, I'm not able to do this. The genia is able to analyze each step, right? And tell you where exactly you're missing your going from.\nRight.\n\n@55:13 - Jagbir Singh\nRight. Right.\n\n@55:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. Right. Right. Right. OK. Equation is pretty good. The telus which is a cutter that a software can do that, today it can.\nCorrect, Right, so this software was a competitor for your khanukadm.\n\n@56:11 - Jagbir Singh\nRight, I've built it about three years back.\n\n@56:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe khanukadm sure who was as if they were putting out, then we were competing with them. Then to the extent of MMA, merges and acquisitions, right?\ncompany has a community, right? But now that come together, and can have a company that come together, and then they will have together.\nI've in with this, I'm with guided things, we've been actually summarizing not only summarizing. You can do Internet research of that company.\nYou can give public state companies, right? So, public state data may or do internet research of like, or the internet is not the same.\nIt is system that is the company's company's It is the company's They can work more expensive and work work more They can work more expensive.\ncan more expensive. Right? Based on that, if you are able to improve, it is doing wonderful models. They can experiment with companies' sponsored words.\nsame way we have to compete with the market. So, we look at the US market, makes AP tests open, advanced placement desk, which makes more famous, which is the balance.\nThat is a very competitive book. one of the best books for AP. We were able to turn a book that somebody bought, which was competing balance.\nIt was not easy. easy. not easy. three months to create that software. effort to do that, but Achke Redmay, if there is somebody who knows Genai well, has that core knowledge?\nThere are a lot of things we can join up. Hello, Tika.\n\n@58:11 - Jagbir Singh\nI've got the idea to marry personal growth-kill app, token resources, but how which I can go through? That my own knowledge around Genai plus potential use cases complex use cases I can apply.\nLet's say my core area is now a depot of cyber security, data plate, home analytics, anyway, that could be anything.\nBut at the of the day, if I want to equip myself to make best use of currently available technology stack of Genai, what are top two, three resources I should spend my time with.\n\n@58:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nA BA problem in Genai. And a misconception more global matter. We must consider Genai. Genai is an idea in EMU.\nSo I know based on your particular demand, I also understand to certain extent, we are in line with understanding.\n\n@59:16 - Jagbir Singh\nidea is here, if you are randomly coming to YouTube, are going to go to Twitter, are to go are going are going Google, paste gravity or any of these steps, So it could be key oxide, specific sk who summarized all the All jacks closely, which will reflect Alice the talk of will be good Potuts\nin bits and pieces, also have lot of information, but let's start with scratch key to understand AI tool and to let's say make use of AI.\n\n@1:00:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's really best to get to Twitter, Google, are regular updates there. I can share some of these with you.\nnumber one, you can do that.\n\n@1:00:21 - Jagbir Singh\nAnd as I said, I have a lot of work here, which is a YouTube video, Twitter profiles, X profile, I think it would be beneficial for me, as a basic understanding, but want to accelerate that understanding so that I can make use of whatever is available for my own use cases.\n\n@1:00:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat is your purpose is, I want to improve my knowledge about how LLM works.\n\n@1:00:48 - Jagbir Singh\nLLM works and then I can understand, okay, I have these certain use cases, which is something can be integrated now with LLM to make, you know, to increase my ROI or, you know, get\n\n@1:01:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you do not have to do something, you need to connect me with people. If you need to connect me with people.\nReach out to them and go to the camera and you can interview them. Hello, TK. am right here to jump on.\n\n@1:01:19 - Jagbir Singh\nBut we are good.

        "content": "Transcript\nMarius Vorster - March 05\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 42 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:00 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nHi everybody how's it going?\n\n@0:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm so sorry my PC to leave itself the moment I joined the call.\n\n@0:08 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nNo worries, no worries. Yeah, so you're not so good.\n\n@0:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet me give you a very brief because we already lost time and I don't want to waste a lot of your time so leave you a very quick brief on what exactly you're trying to do and and where this joins it and then we can probably take the questions down and take it from that.\nit make sense to you? Sure, go for it.\n\n@0:32 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nPerfect.\n\n@0:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, um, gen AI has come in time, right? Everybody wants to be on the bandwagon. Everybody wants to have something of their own doing something just depending on the board doing something but they're again on ground, right?\nWhen we say on ground means in reality, what is the tangible benefit that they are getting out of it?\nOne, what part of gen AI is helping them? actually are you helping you to get that tangible benefit out of it?\nAnd what part you've tried, we've tried a best but it doesn't really do a great job here, right? So the idea is to meet around 200 CTOs and CEOs and try to get their view on what works for them, what doesn't work for them.\nOne, second, right now how are they trying to implement this? You're looking at the future in mind because things are coming in and we have to do a lot of things.\nHow does this fit in into their roadmap and how is this being utilized currently in the organization? In a nutshell, that's what we are aiming at.\nI will start with a few basic questions to set the cohort, right? And then we will go into a free form interview where I'll put over certain questions and you can take the stage and play upon you.\nDoes it make sense? Come, fire away.\n\n@1:54 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nAwesome.\n\n@1:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo this should begin with what organizations would you like to\n\n@2:00 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\num talk on behalf of and again uh it is uh it is okay to say that hey i don't want this to be quoted and it is absolutely fine to say hey i do not want to share these numbers that's absolutely fine right this is a research paper from one of india's most premier business schools so works okay i'm like in general i'll tell you about this and then i think it's confidential i don't want to share i think in most of this a lot of the conversation unless not afraid like this i think the conversation around the relevance and the practicality about ais an essential one to have because there's no here definitive answer absolutely otherwise being able to converse and have this little conversations helps create clarity in an area where there is i want to say a lot of subjectivity and uncertainty right now so as much as possible i'll share and have conversation around that i\ndo think that there is like their strengths and weaknesses but I don't know if you saw the conversation with such an adult like that was recently released where he's actually making the very interesting statement that saying that basically AI is still built very much still in the initial investment and prototyping stage and that it can't see the economical benefit yet of all the money that they spent and they're slowing down pretty much their their investment into it until they're more or less caught up in there as well.\nSo these I would say that there's like interesting movements obviously of throwing billions of rounds like with not building money.\nYou know like AI startups like and Tropic and you know like even open IOS burning money every single day you know so it's like anyway this thing that it's a good information to have and we all hopefully through dialogue will get closer towards what the reality of it is in the future.\nSure.\n\n@3:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo to begin the conversation what What organization and what industry and what sector would you say these insights come from?\nYou are insights. Am I insights?\n\n@4:10 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nOkay, thank you. what we like, we are a financial fantic company. So we focus on trade credit. So what we do is we provide some other businesses a bit to be how much credit they can give somebody else, you know, when they're buying stocks in services products before they will be trading kind of at unnecessary risk.\nSo we kind of facilitate that the big large enterprises can help fund their customers, want to say cash flow, and be able to buy products and stock in a basic ego and resell it before they don't have to have all of the stock in capital up front, know, and we just help making sure that relationship between the two is analysis.\n\n@4:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you are basically hedging based on the data that, hey, when this person is going to pay you back, don't worry about it, let's go ahead and do the stuff, right?\n\n@4:59 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nRight. that bureaus, bureaus is a very long-term transactional view on it. take like more a book-level investment, look at it, and we look at it like, you know, we want people to get credit.\nWe don't want to stop it. The question is not, should they create credit? It's very few times that you say no.\nThe question is more around, what is the size level of credit that I can provide for them to risk?\n\n@5:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou can actually take, and what is the risk level for this particular investment that you're making? 100%.\n\n@5:25 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nIt's very much industry, customer, a big customer, what we call a buyer on the other side. Data is pretty cool for us.\nwould say that we are in the industry that already looked at AI long before the modern generative, I want to say, these kind of stuff that is now very hot topics.\nWe were doing the traditional, like I want to say, statistical modeling, the kind of stuff we were doing long before, and we moved from, you know, like descriptive, like descriptive, and we actually went from from descriptive.\nto prescriptive analytics, where we actually not just give you inside of the forecasting of what will happen, how you should react to that and what you should be doing.\nSo we would say we're very much strong in that space. The question around the the viability and the impact that we're letting not go ahead, that's what we do.\n\n@6:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what would you say will be the company size in terms of employees in the revenue rate now? Sure, so I think it's 50 people, so it's not massive.\n\n@6:35 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nWe have a revenue of I think it's about 50 million a year somewhere in that facility, so it's not a massive company.\nwhat is I think more interesting is the fact that we processed the data that we've processed for our customers that leads to the analytics and the insight is we've processed more than 500 billion rounds worth of trade careers for our customers.\nSo it's an honorable it's about 6.5% in relationship to the GDP of the country, like almost 6.5%. And this is for a company that's only been trade like active for the last two and a whole three years.\nthink it's like, you know, shows how quickly, you know, you can add value within this fashion.\n\n@7:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's a big achievement and that cannot be done without using AI, but AI in the generic sense of AI, right?\nAnd now, since I understand this, most of this will be and not of the AI as we have known it for the last 20 years and we will be working on the regression and the models and getting prescriptions out of it.\nBut the core focus of today's talk would be generative AI, right?\n\n@7:41 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nDoing a week segment and we will boil down there.\n\n@7:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI totally understand that a lot of things that we have done, all the cool stuff that we have done in this would be really do AI, right?\nBecause I also work with some M&A companies to do these things across and that is the cool. how things would build up.\nSo in terms of GI, what what builds up here?\n\n@8:05 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nSo I think we want to start off with the problem of black box AI in financial interviews. So the problem with black box, the limitations of black box is two things.\nThe first thing that is difficult is it's like the described ability or the why. Why did I get this answer?\n\n@8:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'll try to reduce this just to save time. Being in the industry and working with finance also, it has been 27 years now in the industry.\nI will put certain things out so that we can shorten the duration black box in terms of syntax. totally understand we cannot have a non-explanable derived.\nI'm not going to give something to somebody. Is it because of bias? Is it because of I mean, why do you give them also, right?\n\n@9:04 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nThe one thing that we've seen that actually addresses this in the generative AI work is the RAG systems, right?\nSo the RAG systems are able to do, like, give you the why behind that. But there's a second component to financial industry, which is extremely important, but is not covered by it.\nAnd that is job one, geez, I feel like I like it. But it's the two seconds, I've got it over here, I didn't workshop on this yesterday.\nI'm not going to read my own behind right committees, the deterministic factor of this. what you want to have, you don't want to have the questions same times and get four different results.\n\n@9:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's to lead to deterministic because we need the same answer as many times as you want to ask a question, right?\n\n@10:05 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nAnd that's understandable. It needs to be something that you can sign off from a governance policy and things you need both.\nSo the problem is, I think, in our world, there's a lot of people think that RAG systems solves it, but it does not, right?\nNow, it's important to understand that I think we're talking about the final answer now. We're not talking about the input.\n\n@10:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd this is where it started getting interesting.\n\n@10:31 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nLike, we use kind of MLM-based technologies through partners, right? That does things like document analysis. in South Africa, something is big, is we use bank state, which is not really used in other parts of the world.\nBut basically, you an extract of auto transactions of your bank account, and then it's used to kind of determine some things like your capacity and all kinds of kind of mechanisms.\nthose stuff is not great. And processing documents that's not always in the same structure. So we have found that we can utilize this kind of capabilities to do automation of things that typically had a 30% success rate, if the PDF doesn't like isn't the right type of PDF for those kind of things.\nSo we think that the role of the modern AI systems, this will be the RAGs, kind of stuff, and even maybe a genetic AI to a certain degree, will be more focused around these aspects of automation and in user computing.\n\n@11:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLike you get things which we are not able to process through regular means, we are able to process that and get that data out.\nNow, what percentage of it is accurate is another question.\n\n@11:44 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nThat comes separately. It's good that you say that, but it's not that is you break through one to one relationship.\nWhere you have to have human involvement with every single transaction. Now you do a level of confidence and you use the human person as a distillation path, making the person being able to process like 1 to 10, 1 to 20, 1 to 30, right.\nAnd that's a significant benefit, right, that you have in there. not insignificant, but it's indirect. It's not, it's not on the final stage.\ncan't, you can't just use that, like, throw it through a rag while on top of your elementary accommodation should I give.\nAbsolutely. Another thing that's quite important, which is something that is often overlooked, is that a specialist system will always outperform the generalist system.\nRight. if you have, this is why you create GBTs on top of charge of BT to be able to answer specific questions.\nNow that doesn't mean your specialist systems can't use AI, still can use AI, but the point is that you will, there will always be a role in which need to find specialized solutions.\nBut even if you're removing the confusion, you're making it, you're making the delta of\n\n@13:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nit's smaller, right? So the relationships can be found much better, otherwise it's just going to the world and coming back.\n\n@13:06 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nCorrect, and it's almost like it's so wide that the the effectiveness of that can't be controlled, like you have to give it like boundaries.\nAnd boundaries and direction, like this is how we treat certain things, like if we or what to ask questions, use this philosophy, use this way of working for product management, use this thing and then that creates boundaries and contexts and then it executes well.\nLike, I think that it will have, like when you're talking about like how Amazon, or the base or some people talk about how this will touch every aspect of your life and it will improve it, I think they're correct.\nBut I think where people are getting it wrong is I think that they have this idea that they will be launched.\nchunks of solutions and products and services that will just suddenly disappear because it will be replaced by the single system that will do everything.\nI don't think that's what's going to happen. think those things will still exist. Just portions of them will be automated, portions of that will be effective and the answers will be given better than to provide.\nAnd that's a problem, right? Because the problem is that the R&B investment into this is astronomical, right? And it's astronomical and indirect results.\nAnd that is, I think, we're open to AI as a problem right now, is they have funded a lot of this, but they can't properly convert it into a commercially viable solution because it's indirect.\ncan't just pull the trigger and suddenly make $100 billion, right? we're somebody like, like, see because some of the other guys is coming in that can kind of or even we'll see about drop because drop also is a significant investment in that but I'm sure it's that for other revenue streams and funding so it's less of an issue over that.\n\n@15:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, the block has as ultimate idea investment in terms of using X as the background engine and using that there's a different ball game all together with block.\n\n@15:24 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nGreat, they can almost do a cost sharing thing you know where somebody that's purely focused on AI as a problem because they have to generate money on something that has an indirect and a very like widespread like value offering if it's not pinpoint targeted and that leads us to the problem is a lot of this pinpoint accurate targeting requires proprietary data requires access to all kinds of different things that they have to partner when this is X wins that's because of X glock means it has that data he has access that correct and you'll find that\nactual institutions like Manx might have information that they're not allowed to process, which means that can't provide financial products to a certain degree around that.\nSo it's a very glad that it's happened, but I think we'll get into a stage where the guys that made it happen almost like, I think it was, what was the judgy Siemens or the all digital camera story where the initial investor guys spent all of the money, got all the road pops and the guys, the second generation of the second group of companies, the company is actually the guys that's getting the money and getting the benefits of the result from.\nIt said, but it seems like it's going that direction. I totally agree.\n\n@16:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd if we just try to point it down, okay, now if we look internally within the organization that you're running and probably other organizations that you've worked with, what do you feel has been the biggest win tangibly using JNI?\nAnd how do you call it the biggest, why do you call it the biggest?\n\n@17:01 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nI think processing masses of information and what I mean with that is like research is down. Understanding problem states is faster, learning is faster, I think knowledge management, I think that in the biggest impact, the fact that I can use, just because I was interested in the stuff that's happening in the space of quantum computing, I wanted to understand particle physics better.\nAnd within a week of dialogue with tragic IT, I was able to understand subatomic particles to the degree that I would have taken me much longer in like I would say, like a standardized course learning kind of experience, because I was completely in control of the conversation, I could double dive deep into something and step back and move around understanding the context in a very complicated topic in a very specific context better because I could refine it.\nIt's almost like don't know. if you know, like Aristotle and Plato and Socrates. But Socrates didn't want to try to do that.\nYou don't want to write anything down because you say the context of the conversation is so important. And I think that that's where all aims of this kind of technology is extremely helpful because it's context aware.\nYou can navigate these kind of things research as far as I think that the traditional things of knowing things, the peppers are mostly powerful because they solve complex problems in the past and they can block those kind of stuff.\nIt will be extremely fast-track through it. You won't have the same kind of limitations in learning and browsing stuff that you have in the past.\nSo yes, I do think that that is not an insignificant thing. But the problem with it is a very difficult thing to commercialize and make money for it.\n\n@18:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo in terms of this experiment, said, what I understood and I might be wrong so you can correct me.\nThere's a ton of unstructured data, and you want to pull information out of it, so the biggest win that you see is basically converting that unstructured data into a structure that you can use actually.\nIs that a right understanding?\n\n@19:14 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nIt is, and maybe this is a little bit of IP that I'm giving it away, but it's not like it's a massive secret.\nI think the answer lies in three stages, this is not my personal thing, right? I'm adding access to proprietary data, taking that proprietary data and unstructured sources and generating a curated data set.\nNow, this is a futuristic world kind of world, and then from a curated data set, you build things like, again, traditional tools like model registries and these kind of stuff, then you answer it deterministically wise.\nVery difficult questions through this access to a wider set of curated data that you would have it in the past if you didn't have that tools, but that's the\nPart is, I think in a lot of places where you have high risk, high reward or answers that you need to provide that's governed, that's like in the financial sector and there's other areas like that as well.\nYou cannot buy parts, almost I say the traditional wisdom of the traditional AI parts, there's still a fundamental final set of bringing all of this together and making a real impact and it's not just having a prototype of something that sounds amazing and you get 80% of it done within like you know two weeks or three weeks but you can never actually implement any production because that last 20% under, you can't protect against it, you can't like extend massive x factor on that last 20% and it feels wrong because it feels like you know like just for that last little bit you need to spend about 500 times the effects you were able to get it but without that it's not it's not tangible, it's not the\n\n@21:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd this is a problem with every part of the industry, so it's not for variety to be very candid with you.\nEverybody has exactly the same feeling and they have exactly the same issue. is going to shoot it down, right?\nAny system is as strong as the weakest part, right? And if this part is giving me 20%, which means it's going to multiply further on.\nAnd that's where things get shot down there. So coming back to the business problem, you said this is the biggest tangible benefit that you have.\nCan you put it down in terms of numbers or final production value or let's say...\n\n@21:47 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nIt's an efficiency and a coverage on said not a commercial rank value thing. So I would say that as an example, we used to do OCRs and we used to use that R banks that...\nthe seems to be at a success ratio of about 30% right? We just not correct.\n\n@22:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you very much. Yeah.\n\n@22:08 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nAnd now with that, in technologies, we can process, I think, with a lot less human involvement first. And secondly, with a lot larger coverage of different types of and things, I think it's about 70, between 70 and 75% or than that we can do.\nSo, all coverage, but the process is significantly faster, right? But here's the scary part. We don't do anything with that.\nWe use an API and we've seen this stuff still and we get the answer back, right? We don't have to be all M&Rag experts.\nWe can outsource that, bring things that and bring the value back into our system and use our traditional tools to do the rest.\nSo, we get the value of all of this billion spend. And it costs us a fractional transactional value to include in our business.\nThere's absolutely no reason for me to go and build an AI team that can do an AI and technology.\nThere's no reason why I need to compete to Google and to open AI and Microsoft and everybody else in this space, because I won't win, but I can leverage that to make me like a very good position in the market.\nAbsolutely.\n\n@23:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when deep-seek R1 and the other things that we have been playing out in the open open-source market, if you want to go deeper, we can still do that without actually involving the players, right?\nAnd to be very frank, in my experience, it becomes cheaper with a bigger player I if I had to run my own system and I would run stuff, it becomes more expensive unless I'm doing it in a very large scale, right?\nSo these players are cheaper, much cheaper, much better for me to actually do it. the benefits of economies of scale.\n\n@24:02 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nI don't actually think we're there yet. I think that the exception of the guys that kind of piggy-packed and like deep-sick retraining on open AI, I think that's a little bit of an unfair boost in the background.\nBut I think that we all very much, I think that such an adult has a very interesting point that he's writing.\nHe's saying that we almost need to, we need to, what's the right word, not okay, but we need to throttle the investment, the stage gate investments of the new AI kind of hardware and you know like to the economical impact that it's making so that we make sure we don't over-invest and he's not saying we shouldn't invest.\nIt's moment that we start seeing this exponential benefits on then get exponentially invest more money into the AI. But until we've done it, all of this is\nlike a height like it's like it's the dot com thing it's the you know like it's the blockchain conversation it's all these things if it's not tangible value on the other side it's i think i think what do i it i call it a think about model you know like we're looking for believe it you know you know the way i put it by this the way i put it is people have seen a key called generative air and they're searching for a lock instead of that what they should do is search for a problem they need to solve and then use the right key for it exactly what is happening the other part that we have in the first which i think is actually the the biggest blockage of AI releasing tangible economical impact into the world would be that humanity and people has a comfortable right of\nchange, right? And if you push too hard, people reject change, even if the change is better, right? And if we can look at how it happened with Tesla, you know, you know, he came with too much modern ideas and he was shunned from the community, right?\nThere will be a point that if AI changes too much too fast, there will be a natural resistance ball up and pushing back against that, you know?\nAnd I think that there's a little bit where we're like, like I see, like our business and other business and potential playing in this, people want to know that they using SIF AI and they're really future-proof, but they don't want to spend the effort of changing every single model once a new version is released and now they're jumping from one to another.\nSo what we need is we save harbors where companies look at the advancements in AI and safely implements them, not aggressively, safely implements them, you know, making sure we incorporate\nRight, new advances, new capabilities, intangible business benefiting, where it's such a way that businesses don't feel this storm, the storm of change.\nBut it's still being incorporated, we're not ignoring it, it's being done safely, and it's not slowing down. It's about tailoring the tech with the output.\nAnd you've mentioned it, binding it to something which is a problem, binding it to something that has a real role face.\nAnyway, I think we're going to see that the VC is going to have a hard knock when you start doing all these investments and all of these AI ideas.\nAnd then you'll find it's the problem actualization of idea, the problem actually designs in consumer interface loyalty. I've got to add these kind of stuff that's going to make it ideas that sounds revolutionary.\nOnly a small portion of that will actually be successful.\n\n@28:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, 100% agree with but maybe we wrong and the next model changes everything and can do everything and all traditional businesses are not done.\nThis is not in line with the interview but I'm still going to say it because I mean it feels good to have a chat with somebody who has this knowledge, to be very true, right?\nIf I look at the trajectory of LLMs in the last one year, they have done nothing new. All they have done is they have put reasoning on top of it, they have put, I mean, and all this we have done two years back with LLM, right?\nI I have been one of the earlier proponents of LLM we have researched and we have done a lot with ESW group and all these things that I see coming out today, desktop movement, mouse is moving and doing something.\nAll this has been done way back. What they are trying to do now is productize that and put it forward.\n\n@29:05 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nThese are the models of the Euro public.\n\n@29:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, and that's what I see. So, truly, I mean, very truly, I don't see anything different in the last one year in the case of Italy.\nNothing more.\n\n@29:21 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nI always say that I think it's different is that the general public is more acceptable than I know that they were in the past.\nIt's not really a technology tool thing.\n\n@29:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's more like the people are...\n\n@29:35 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nI think CHAGGIC team made people aware that it's not... In the past, people were fearful of the black boxes.\nLike, you could not use it at all. These days, people are more like, tell me more about that. I'm not sure they'll use every time and money, but it's not there.\n\n@29:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIn the past, you couldn't even discuss that.\n\n@30:00 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nyou know, like, so there's, there's, there's, there's, but again, like, I think that comes with a safe rate of change.\nThat's right. push too hard on that, like, people could lock up and it could go back to the positive, like, we don't trust AI.\nnot the best. That's true.\n\n@30:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm coming back on this. Is there any other thing that you think made a humongous difference? Any other thing in generative air that really made a big difference and tangible difference?\nwhat was the tangible difference?\n\n@30:30 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nI briefly touch on this and it's not something that has made a big difference yet, but the place where I think that has the biggest disruptive potential for, for this technology, I think is education.\n\n@30:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI've got extensively on education side, right? And we have created products, we have done trials with students, and it has been like, again, two years back, one year back, right?\nAnd it has awesome benefits, tangible benefits.\n\n@32:01 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nSo I see your internal technology systems usually it's these days like software development is well understood, know, domain, there's lots of good practices, there's a lot of methodology, systems, ops, all kinds of good things that maintain this, even an analytics to a certain degree, but I think the technology tooling of analytics is five years behind development.\nthink that the MLOps and everything is the concept success, but the ease of use of the tooling and the interoperability of the data and everything, it still feels a little bit like 30 stages of maturity, not exactly where we're developing it, but the way that I've seen is in the past, we've been good at building these internal tools and it takes long and it does all kinds of different things, but these tools are kind of solid that you can trust it.\nWhat I'm seeing is there's a movement, there's a movement to say that listen, you've got your internal internal, let's call it end users of the company.\nthat now gets exposed and it's a little bit AI, but it's also low code tools, all kinds of other different things that are happening right now, which is kind of called technology legal prioritization.\n\n@33:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou know, Marcus, the beauty of this, this is something called citizenship development, right? management, we call it citizenship development, and that's like exactly as you're saying, tech democratization, giving low code, no code tools, and this dates back as many years with, I mean, even pre-nets, generally AI coming in, right?\nAnd I mean, look at Siemens, right? Siemens did a great job of it, right? They had that this whole case study published, where they created this code tool and gave it to the actual user, say, you build your own, we have no idea what it is.\nAbsolutely, your spot on on that, perfect.\n\n@33:50 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nSo that's the one part of it. And I think that this is the other part that is quite interesting.\nI think, like, I don't want to use a wrong term. So I think it's called SaaS Business, it's software.\n\n@34:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\na service, but these services are software, which is kind of the reverse of that, all right?\n\n@34:05 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nAnd I think due to this kind of AI enabled like tech startup phase that we've got, we'll see a lot more of these spin up.\nWhy? Because they don't have the capability of running an enterprise, I want to say product, but spinning up a solution for a very matter of problem or a set, that's more right.\nAnd when you're exposing that as a service, you have something of a transactional thing around that. So what I see it, just will be an uptight, I think we'll see all of this pop up for solutions and stuff.\nAnd you won't be able to compete internally because these niches, again, specialist systems are better than general systems. And then we keep it open.\nSorry. And they will be cheaper in some cases also. Or cheaper operationally, like, you know, if you take in the effort and the cost of people, you're everything together.\nYes. And we'll be cheaper to run it. But that's a 100% degree. And what will happen is you'll find that you'll have to have, this is the architectural problem I think we're going to face, is that we need to find a safe way to have bold solutions, like I'm learning a little bit into my theory of art.\nLike, but this is not to keep it back. I also believe in, you know, an abundance versus scarcity, right, like, you know, like, we need to find solutions for this.\nSo what you want to have is you want to build systems and solutions that span from this technical migration end-user optimization, goes into your core systems, and then goes, sticks out into external verticals, stay back in, but create a realistic experience.\nis in a trusted system through the entire landscape. Absolutely. This is where I think and profit or touching on a very powerful concept.\nAnd I'm not going to go into it because, but I think this is the solution.\n\n@36:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, and the problem, the biggest problem is always station will be data. How will you want the data to flow?\nWhere should the data decide? And there's going to be a pattern of problems in those operators, yeah.\n\n@36:29 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nSo the data is one component and it's very important. But what you also need to understand is that the complexity, it's like you know the network effect, right?\nAnd how it escalates with each node that you put in, right? The problem is the moment that you don't do a POC and you do a real world scenario.\nEverything that you add into the system creates another node and the complexity of manage that system often becomes impossible to manage and will grind to a halt from a relation perspective because it's just because.\nmust While you manage all that systems internally in your technology teams, it's easier because you can manage it centrally.\nBut the moment that you have to step out and this technology systems are not bold, you've got APIs and API gateways and those kind of stuff, but it is not bold.\nIt's at best can do workflow. Orchestration is different. Orchestration is side effects causing side effects. It's ontology versus taxonomy kind of view on this kind of stuff.\nAnd what I believe firmly believe, but this is Mario's 102, like this might be saying this. It's not believed that the tuning that we have for orchestration is not adequate for what we need to be doing for the future.\nSo once we've got that sold, maybe a big player like a Microsoft release or something that will do it.\nBut the moment that we have the ability to orchestrate across all of these boundaries, in a way that provides a what's the right word for things that seem similar.\nIt's got that corrected, extendedly looking at it looked like one thing, although it's composed of multiple, it's like we look at ourselves, we look at a single person, but that person consists of organs, organs, consists of cells.\nOnce you have this ability to bring things together in a way that it seems to be one thing, even though it is comprised of different things, you've got auditability, you've got you've got tracking, performance tracking, you've got troubleshooting and support, contracting, you've got all of this stuff, it's like middleware or message brokerage or orchestration, you've got all of this stuff that goes outside of this currently very internal network, which is the internal system.\nSo it reaches into the democratized end users, reaches into external services as software, and you bring that together and you create realistic enterprise solutions, then we have something power.\n\n@38:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou have the needle on the head, you actually have the needle on the head, I mean, I am working on the\nsomething similarly only for software development where even if you change a field the last radius to which which line of code will it make a difference right because you made a change to the database field you convert it from an integer to a long what are the different APIs that will be affected what are the different code pieces that will be affected what is the UI that will be affected which component in the UI will also be affected you need to know that that's something that I was working on and this is exactly what you're saying right this is this is exactly how things are going to go I am very limited to this software right now but yes in the industry this is exactly what's going to happen you're perfect right on this one like I hope so like I'm also holding something and I'm doing it because I I ran into problems where my analytics teams systems and processes didn't integrate well into the development one so I wanted to create like you know state instead out and doing this kind of contracting and doing proper error handling and doing so I'm also working on something like that\n\n@40:00 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nBut what I feel sad about is that there's that easy solution in the space that people, normal companies, they go to, I'm doing this development in my own personal time because I can't point my developers to do this because I've got other work to do, right?\nAnd it's a little bit like, you know, we're handicapped in our ability to productize because there's too much isolation and not enough collaboration between all of those different domains and things today.\nBut like it's a problem and you know, like in the world that we live in, problems create opportunities. somebody is going to do something in this space.\n\n@40:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we'll see. It has been so interesting talking to you and sharing all this that I lost track of time and we are already few minutes over time.\nI have one quick question before I jump out, and that is where did you actually tangibly see it fail in your in front of you?\n\n@40:58 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nFile it, didn't you?\n\n@40:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nReally? failed for you, quickly crashed and wasted a lot of money or any more effort or whatever.\n\n@41:07 - Marius Vorster (Trade Shield)\nGiving very confident financial advice. It's very easy to speak with a lot of confidence and be hallucinating while you're doing that.\nSo yeah, also it was a good conversation and we're gonna good luck with everything and if you learn something and if you think back on me like hey that you didn't think of this and now I learned this.\n\n@41:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSure any point of time you think I can be of any help you know where to reach\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.

Let me try and join through my mobile also so that it will be easier to connect actually I'm outside and my camera and my mic is not behaving quite well the voice is a little bit\n\n@1:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThe reason I will be much more comfortable here. am going to do that.\n\n@1:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGive me a second. Hey, am I audible now? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.\nI am so sorry this was a bit ad hoc for me because I was travelling so apologies for that.\n\n@2:10 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI know. no, no, I am starving. have a problem. Description was a. Yeah. Perfect.\n\n@2:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbasically, let me reduce myself on the key. I have been in technology for about 27 years now. I am doing a small research with IIT Delhi, where we are trying to ascertain, hey, Genai is coming up bigger, everybody is talking about Genai.\nBut on ground, that's all there. Yeah, situation. The voice is not very crispy, maybe some kind of bandwidth or something, it's not.\n\n@2:47 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOkay. Let's get out again.\n\n@2:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat is unfortunate apologies for that.\n\n@2:56 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nNo, now you can shut up your camera also if you want. If you think there is a badness, so what the hell?\nThat'd be great, so let me do that. Yes. You think my voice is better here?\n\n@3:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, much better here. Am I better audible here? Yes, yes.\n\n@3:32 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nPerfect.\n\n@3:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPerfect. That's great. So, I think about 27 years in technology and playing around with a lot of different roles.\nCurrently, I'm playing with small, with IT Delhi, right? This is under-professor Banish, and what we are trying to do is, Giniai is coming up big and Giniai is being, like, touted.\ntalked about by everybody but on ground in reality how is it benefiting the corporates right now the smaller units is it accessible is it something that we can easily reach out to is it even giving us benefits or not right there are lot of lot of different stuff that we would like to explore so that's that's basically the purview of the interview and this is where we want to start does that make sense yeah I guess so I'll give you a brief description of creative graphics the creative graphics is a 21 year old company and then 22 now it was starting a long time back and it is into pre-plus.\n\n@4:40 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nPre-plus means that e-manufacturing to pre-subplete rates which are used for the printing packaging, printing of the packaging you see I mean very can you send it in arcane or any tamper or something or or you know only label of often incur but you will see\nlabel the tags of some kind of picture, which comes as a digital guide to us, we do a lot of the placements, lot of manual intervention, according to the process, according to the need of the client, according to the different parameters and the variables.\nWe do a lot of change, and this is a lot of involvement of a person here, in the kind of way, you know, a lot of skills are required, you know, have been lot of, we, I was just talking to the, this, we will get that with the help of AI, if we can automate, because there happens something more time to automate it, but still after automation, there are a lot of work has to be done, and a lot of time and effort goes into this, which can, we can automate some process through AI, AI, see, see what kind of a variable is involved into this, and this does this kind of a process on the back end, without the involvement of you.\n\n@5:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank one effort.\n\n@6:01 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nWe will be able to get a lot more consistency, reduce cost at speed of the process. That makes sense.\nSo, can we, I just wanted to understand, can we automate that process, or can we do something like this?\n\n@6:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, there are a lot of things that we can actually go do, right? And we will discuss about that probably in, let's say, a latest slot that you can slot out, maybe I can understand your process is more and if you're out more there, okay?\n\n@6:32 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nCurrently, because if you come amongst, you see the process, with my team, then you can see what we are doing actually, right?\n\n@6:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat will require a lot of effort on those aspects where I first understand what you guys are doing and then I can suggest to you, no use that, right?\nNow, right now, we will divide the rest of the into sections, okay? Section one, where I will ask certain questions that I need to\nGod in terms of what you understand and what have you been able to see that will be backed by examples or numbers that you see in your day to day life okay and the second part will be opinions where I would probably want to understand and take your opinions and that might not have a very concrete background but that is what you have heard and understood and I would love to share your opinion on those aspects.\nNow before we start what is the industry and sector where we are right now trying to work and our industry is into printing as you explain and specifically into segmented printing but what what industry would you say this is is the packaging industry or the printing?\n\n@7:43 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThis is printing package. This is largely we are not operating up we don't perfect\n\n@8:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when we talk about this industry, are there multiple sectors in this industry or is this like the slot where we are?\n\n@8:11 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nNot so much, but I'll just give you some kind of explanation. When we see printing on a package, I think on a package is going to be here.\nThat's right. This is not going to be shifted to some kind of digital data as the newspaper and everything has been shifted to.\nBut this remains real. And there are three processes of packaging or printing. One is offset, second is graduate, third which we are doing is a flexo.\nSo flexing is being a very new process and we say you still is a 30-40 year old in India.\n\n@8:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd it is a growing technology.\n\n@8:51 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo we, the, our first client gives up as a file. Let's say a file of a pamper. A child is sitting on a list or a designer.\n\n@9:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe design is being given to you.\n\n@9:01 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThe design is being done by the agency or the client side or the brand owner. They keep that design to us.\nBut that design has to be converted into the process oriented. Like if it has to be printed on a flexor, it has to be converted into flexor design.\nTo the need of the process according to the variables of the process. If it has to be printed on a graduate process, then the design of the commercial is totally different.\nOn the show. 3 of the processes are totally different. They need different tools, things, different variables are involved.\n\n@9:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe treatment is totally different.\n\n@9:42 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo now if the file comes to us, we will see it from the flexor graphic perspective. We have some input data.\nWe have to get less than if your picture of this wiki. You can see a picture of your office in a digital file and I have to print that picture on a paper.\nTo work like that, know, your paper. case looks exactly similar. Let's say we have that opera's picture on the opera's arrow head.\nThe brand would like that opera's picture to be real, like the period cut opera to be printed on this.\nBut there is a lot of effort and this effort is to be done by the all still the highest from our side, but that's fine.\nwe press file and we cut. So, that is our process. Right.\n\n@10:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, that's a part of the process. first part where you basically take a design and convert it to a flexor format, right?\nWhat's the other format or other steps after this?\n\n@10:38 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, one of the flexors, the file which is, if you have some printing background, the file is made up of different colors, right?\nBut that can be ripped into basic colors. every color is made up of a large series. So, you're using CMYK or what?\nto see either it can be printed through CMYK or even a special color. Also, I don't see CMYK or what are the color gradient that is a skill player.\nSo, our printing media will access the job. We will see the quality of the machine and the team can put many other parameters and would decide that this job will be printed in 4.5, 6, 7, 8.\nAnd after that they do color correction, then the file is separated into that store many colors. Yes, is printed in 4 colors, will be separated in 4 colors in different areas.\nRight.\n\n@11:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat is called ripping.\n\n@11:39 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, that is what ripping. So, that file is ripped into a different color.\n\n@11:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou know that dot.\n\n@11:51 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, every picture is considered of a small dot. We don't have a large storage.\n\n@11:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have some basic background about the printing industry.\n\n@12:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nsoftware and that dot further gets ripped into a small pixels. That pixels are then again reviewed or you know go for QC and we just we see what kind of a quality output is coming in something.\nEverything is go well then these findings go for hard imaging where these pixels are imaged onto a flexible graphic printing plate which is a photo polymer plate made up of an iron polymer.\nThen this those plates are through a process are imaged and that plate them goes for the printing.\n\n@12:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's that's basically the negative you would say for that image where you use that polymer sheet that you have created with the imaging and that sheet is used for printing or you have that file with this tested on the polymer and that file is used for printing.\nNow that file is imaged when it's after testing that file is imaged onto a photo polymer plate that file that's the embedded let's embedded onto a photo polymer plate and we have a erected image okay or the photo polymer plate this is through a process when you see the plate then it will come to know so that after that that plate is used for the printing Great understood and printing is done by you or some other computer you are not a printer you're not a printer so you basically are this pre-printing agency where the design comes to you you make all the changes you do the QC you do the imaging you do the plating and after the print has been done you give it for printing for the perfect perfect that gives me a very clear understanding thank you so much I really had no deep insight into this now in this entire process are we today using any AI in any way so now we are working with some software something like S4 okay.\n\n@13:56 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nS4 is one of the largest because company just got a software. where they have been working on automation, we are working on automation but it is not AI driven as per se, there are some automation but still a lot of human effort goes into it.\nIt has to be done by a higher skill person. So they say automation, if they have a kind of a profile meeting and put the file into it, it can be done through it.\nBut it has to be still decided by the print engineer. So basically you need a lot of domain knowledge to be able to find the same thing.\nunderstood.\n\n@14:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nso what I understand is that although we are doing automation but we are not using a lot of AI right now.\nNot actually. And what is the reason that we are not able to go to AI? it just because the domain knowledge is so eye oriented or so human oriented that we cannot go there?\nOr what do you think is the reason? No but I think that they happen to\n\n@15:01 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\ninitiative from the company, there is a lot of lot of focus on this, maybe there is only one company who has been sitting onto the pile of already developed software they just not go let it go or something, maybe that could be the reason, I think there is a definitely a lot of things which can be automated through AI, we can reduce the environment of human right as a kind of you know for the automation on the back of you know platform there are lot of things can be taken by AI, okay understood and is it like we are using AI in other aspects of the organization like HRM or thing other, nothing other wrong because this is something that you know I have seen a lot of employees of mine have started\nYeah, sending a very good return way, I know, because this is I think they are going to be challenging me to go right go, I that's good.\nThat's good.\n\n@16:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's good. That's a start somewhere at least but I mean that probably is so do you guys have to market as well go out in the market and market yourself or is it more like word of mouth where you already know the industry people know you and they come to you automatically.\n\n@16:30 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOh, you know, you cannot be have a Monopus situation when we ask to be visibility that there is a mutual kind of a thing when we happen in the industry being the largest player for so long.\nSo, lot of this comes directly to us but still we have to approach there is a team and a sales team, there is a double shooting team.\nThat's all we just that makes sense for both of us.\n\n@16:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd do the sales team use things like chargey-bick sector to create presentations or build staff through the coordination of the firm.\n\n@17:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOr do we even use this for reaching out to people?\n\n@17:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet us say there are 10 companies I want to reach out to. Is there some medicine? I'm not sure.\n\n@17:07 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI'm very, very, interested. Okay. I'm not using any kind of a state. All right.\n\n@17:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd do you think that something like this would help in the coming run?\n\n@17:18 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThat's an efficient vision for the vision for the company.\n\n@17:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's the next five years. you think this is? Picky, that is our target.\n\n@17:24 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nAnd as a company, we have been a strategizing to reduce the human burden. mean, because there is a lot of any competition.\nEverything has been so competitive. biggest component in other industries, human component, the kind of, you know, the family, which has a lot of pressure.\nAnd we have a, this is a special industry. There's a lot of, one of the smallest cat. Got it.\nSo, to have that kind of a consistency and to achieve these kind of tests each and every time. It is a huge effort to remain competitive to remain once ahead of the competition, automation and AI and these kind of things as one, one and only one solution in coming years, okay?\nI hear you.\n\n@18:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in what fields do you think that we have the low-hanging tools? example, we have the entire second that you start with that design and then we worked on it and the flow is a workflow that you do.\nIn between this workflow, what do you think are the lowest hanging tools where we can actually just go and get some quick returns or quick benefits?\n\n@18:40 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo I tell you like when we receive a file, so our people make a no the way to whatever feature, if the file is not red table then we send the file again to the client.\nOkay, we should see the file, make a drop bar allocated, if there is something wrong with the file and\ncan send them back to the to the mother or maybe they want to fire to be able to get back fire and get out it can be sent to them.\nSo these are the questions. I think these things can be easily achievable.\n\n@19:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right and how many times let us say out of 100 what percentage times do you actually send the file back manually 100 that is that is really a time saver in that case.\n\n@19:35 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nAnd that doesn't only require effort but also pile because then in the person we will have to get there happen one of these kind of things when the file is also you know received by my team there is one we we make a job card right this job part is manually prepared it is lot of time you know I have asked all mistake has a very big impact when there is some communication gap between the under\nkind of the main or you know some feature that that it travels till the last moment right maybe it may be into some loss to the country.\nSo, there are so many things which can be automated where we are you know when we talk about is one we are prone right two mistakes because we are doing multitasking every time we are not present at the at times with the same same amount of work.\nSo, this is human and we are looking forward that to make a really good optics to our next level company to be very comprehensive.\nThe automation and these kind of technologies are really critical in coming future for us.\n\n@20:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great. I missed a question. So, in terms of company size what would be our company size in terms of team and revenue?\n\n@20:51 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, you if we have two articles one is native graphics which is into pre-press flexor pre-press right. manufacturer flexor plates, the turnover is 100 crores of okay.\nAnd another is packaging company which is mainly into lamination and the panel should be packaging that is, that is a conversion algorithm you can start.\nSo, we are talking more about this prepress, this is 100 crores and we talk about flexor because we are mainly discussing in the real world flexor.\n\n@21:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow many people do we have roughly done in this? Starting size.\n\n@21:27 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nTalk about the whole of the organization we will have close to 400 people okay. And which can be reduced to a lot, a lot less number of people that is a target actually.\nUnderstood, understood.\n\n@21:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis makes a lot of sense. you said the first part that you can actually reduce right where you see low hanging fruit is basically job called handling and printing returns, correct?\nThey are you know in every process.\n\n@21:55 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nTalk about the content, there are a lot of people doing lot of that with the content still. It doesn't work that well unless until you have a person sitting and driving that in a very different way.\nNo, you have to drive that force every time there has to be somebody who is checking another one. This is something I just want to get rid of.\nWe have people on the people. This is something happening. If you see, there are a huge plethora of people.\nYou know, they are kind of... We will go out of the cognitive advantage. I understand.\n\n@22:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd that's not your core area. So you don't want to focus on it because it's not your core area.\nYou would rather focus on your core area and start working on that part.\n\n@22:41 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo if I go and employ somebody who will go into AI development or something, I will end up wasting a lot of time and energy and money.\n\n@22:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWithout even getting the right result to us.\n\n@22:56 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nBut it's not your core area. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. As a creative, are very, very much focused, that things we don't do, we just give it to the third party, we are only industrial doing, which can be covered in the revenue, we know, which we have got.\nMakes sense. Makes sense.\n\n@23:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, one part of this, what do you think is the second part, this will really greatly benefit from AI or something, in those accords.\n\n@23:30 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nWell, largely, you know, this is, we are talking about the business violence, so creating graphics has actually a requirement of this tool, second tool could be the color management, color management.\nSo, when we talk about the color management, we, the system, because we put lot of input and, you know, we, the system tries to simulate the press, know, because having applied play, then running under the\nand don't not get in the right kind of color, correct, the really big task and it actually results in a lot of losses for us and for the press and the loss of.\nSo, this can also be the help of AI, can be predicted well that this file will result in this kind of a actual print result and do it with this kind of things or this kind of a system.\nSo, this will actually would be a game changer because a company has been riddled with these kind of issues.\nare the two stresses where the every minute counts, is a lot of substrate, it goes into the mean, it goes for sustaining into the cause of manufacturing will go drastically low absolutely and we can see in advance that what is going to be printed, we still can but still there is a lot of that.\nSo, if they it goes can be done through artificial intelligence. Then definitely it could be a game changer. Makes sense.\n\n@25:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd what do you think will not be beneficial with AI? for Kuchy, as you know, by AI core, then the AI needs that.\nThis is something that really needs a human, cannot actually go and do AI. do you think? What are those things?\n\n@25:19 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, I think in today's world, where we are working towards a lot of new technologies, innovations. So, there are few things.\nOne thing is that we have been both day and night India, because that can definitely be done by artificial intelligence.\nthey have something to bring on artificial intelligence. I think largely these things can be done, but, you know, when it comes to human interaction, it's about building the team, it's about building the relationship with the client, and these, many other things can definitely not be.\nthat delegated to this sort of a thing. Other than that, I think most of the things currently. Awesome, awesome.\n\n@26:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat makes a lot of sense. that's where I've been talking to other CEOs. that's what they have also been relating to me on.\nSo now, other than this, in terms of, let's say, people management, or you might have some problems where people might get to you.\nAnd you are as a B2B, generally. So is it like you have a person always on call to handle problems and all?\nOr do you think that there is a scope in terms of, in terms of, say, a query resolution, or issues, what to answer from my point of view, as it's now?\nOr there are the two, three types of queries.\n\n@26:52 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOne is that is, because of the process, is that, you what is the status of play? It's, what, what the status of\nreach what is a eating a these are a lot of queries which can really go on a minute right the system we want either so many other thing which which means personal touch whether plan would like to know about the pie this is something he would like to say and would like to get some manual changes right you know these are things which which will take some time maybe when the mindset of the buyer also changes you know it will set these kind of definitely acceptable in near future but in the short term future I think this is to be quite efficient that that means a lot of sense and I really like your direction of thought there what I will do is separately I will try and schedule an interview or a conversation with you where so this is basically for the I will be the project that we were talking about but after coming in we will separately sit down and have a chat right probably go up more let's\nACTION ITEM: Schedule in-person meeting w/ Deepanshu in Delhi to discuss AI implementation for Creative Graphics (flexo pre-press, color mgmt). Msg on WhatsApp upon return to Delhi (~1 week). - WATCH\n\n@28:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmuch deeper in terms of what exactly is being done and what not. I have a basic idea now with this interview.\nWhere do you where do you guys work from? What's your location of work? No I don't.\n\n@28:12 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nNo I don't.\n\n@28:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOh great that's that's nearby I live in Delhi. So maybe one of these days I'll probably drive down and we'll catch up and we'll discuss this further.\n\n@28:22 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nPerfect perfect.\n\n@28:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nup here I'll give you my number. My number is seven three if you can drive it down.\n\n@28:30 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo I'm kind of right or the chat box list. Yeah I'm putting it on the chat board for you.\n\n@28:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is your Google Meet and I am putting on Google Meet. That's my number. You can connect with me on WhatsApp as well.\nSo I'm right now in there alone but in a few days I'll be back in and we can just schedule a call there.\nWe'll meet.\n\n@28:59 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI'll be I will look at what the process is on the ground, which company are working for? I do not work for a company right now.\n\n@29:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nam doing my research with IT Delhi. I am running a small startup which is still not out there. It's called my CPTO and this company basically talks to people and helps people who are either running their own IT team which is not able to do something or who do not have IT team and they want somebody to come in with expertise and help them do something right.\nSo, we work as an external technology team and help them out.\n\n@29:37 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, quickly like we have been discussing that this is a kind of a strategy we are looking at. It's hard to go for this automation of the process and to somebody who is adapted over the basic knowledge of the main.\nIt can help us out and help you kind of you know the human effort and a lot of the human cause I would also say would be really really we have no greater answer.\n\n@30:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo, no worries at all the bunch you it's like because of the people who got sent out like he if he could have joined out there.\nSo this interview probably is that join where you require something and probably something can be done. So, no worries.\nLet me reach Delhi. will be there in probably a week or so. I will take and yeah, drop me a message on my WhatsApp.\n\n@30:36 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThis number is on WhatsApp. Okay.\n\n@30:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI will connect with you when I am in Delhi and we will we will probably meet down at your place, right.\nHave a look at the entire thing and then we can pipeline on something.\n\n@30:47 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOkay. So, can note down my number. is the fan show. Perfect.\n\n@30:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, looking forward a week is there are some queries you can\n\n@31:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI think I have most of the things I required for the interview, but for helping you out, I would need a lot more data.\n\n@31:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's like very different from this interview. So let's catch up in person and let's do this sometime. So perfect.\n\n@31:15 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nyou so much again. you. bye.\n\n@31:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you. Thank you.\n GOEL - February 26\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 32 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you so much for taking it out of our audience. Let me try and join through my mobile also so that it will be easier to connect actually I'm outside and my camera and my mic is not behaving quite well the voice is a little bit\n\n@1:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThe reason I will be much more comfortable here. am going to do that.\n\n@1:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGive me a second. Hey, am I audible now? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.\nI am so sorry this was a bit ad hoc for me because I was travelling so apologies for that.\n\n@2:10 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI know. no, no, I am starving. have a problem. Description was a. Yeah. Perfect.\n\n@2:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbasically, let me reduce myself on the key. I have been in technology for about 27 years now. I am doing a small research with IIT Delhi, where we are trying to ascertain, hey, Genai is coming up bigger, everybody is talking about Genai.\nBut on ground, that's all there. Yeah, situation. The voice is not very crispy, maybe some kind of bandwidth or something, it's not.\n\n@2:47 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOkay. Let's get out again.\n\n@2:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat is unfortunate apologies for that.\n\n@2:56 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nNo, now you can shut up your camera also if you want. If you think there is a badness, so what the hell?\nThat'd be great, so let me do that. Yes. You think my voice is better here?\n\n@3:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, much better here. Am I better audible here? Yes, yes.\n\n@3:32 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nPerfect.\n\n@3:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPerfect. That's great. So, I think about 27 years in technology and playing around with a lot of different roles.\nCurrently, I'm playing with small, with IT Delhi, right? This is under-professor Banish, and what we are trying to do is, Giniai is coming up big and Giniai is being, like, touted.\ntalked about by everybody but on ground in reality how is it benefiting the corporates right now the smaller units is it accessible is it something that we can easily reach out to is it even giving us benefits or not right there are lot of lot of different stuff that we would like to explore so that's that's basically the purview of the interview and this is where we want to start does that make sense yeah I guess so I'll give you a brief description of creative graphics the creative graphics is a 21 year old company and then 22 now it was starting a long time back and it is into pre-plus.\n\n@4:40 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nPre-plus means that e-manufacturing to pre-subplete rates which are used for the printing packaging, printing of the packaging you see I mean very can you send it in arcane or any tamper or something or or you know only label of often incur but you will see\nlabel the tags of some kind of picture, which comes as a digital guide to us, we do a lot of the placements, lot of manual intervention, according to the process, according to the need of the client, according to the different parameters and the variables.\nWe do a lot of change, and this is a lot of involvement of a person here, in the kind of way, you know, a lot of skills are required, you know, have been lot of, we, I was just talking to the, this, we will get that with the help of AI, if we can automate, because there happens something more time to automate it, but still after automation, there are a lot of work has to be done, and a lot of time and effort goes into this, which can, we can automate some process through AI, AI, see, see what kind of a variable is involved into this, and this does this kind of a process on the back end, without the involvement of you.\n\n@5:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank one effort.\n\n@6:01 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nWe will be able to get a lot more consistency, reduce cost at speed of the process. That makes sense.\nSo, can we, I just wanted to understand, can we automate that process, or can we do something like this?\n\n@6:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, there are a lot of things that we can actually go do, right? And we will discuss about that probably in, let's say, a latest slot that you can slot out, maybe I can understand your process is more and if you're out more there, okay?\n\n@6:32 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nCurrently, because if you come amongst, you see the process, with my team, then you can see what we are doing actually, right?\n\n@6:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat will require a lot of effort on those aspects where I first understand what you guys are doing and then I can suggest to you, no use that, right?\nNow, right now, we will divide the rest of the into sections, okay? Section one, where I will ask certain questions that I need to\nGod in terms of what you understand and what have you been able to see that will be backed by examples or numbers that you see in your day to day life okay and the second part will be opinions where I would probably want to understand and take your opinions and that might not have a very concrete background but that is what you have heard and understood and I would love to share your opinion on those aspects.\nNow before we start what is the industry and sector where we are right now trying to work and our industry is into printing as you explain and specifically into segmented printing but what what industry would you say this is is the packaging industry or the printing?\n\n@7:43 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThis is printing package. This is largely we are not operating up we don't perfect\n\n@8:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when we talk about this industry, are there multiple sectors in this industry or is this like the slot where we are?\n\n@8:11 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nNot so much, but I'll just give you some kind of explanation. When we see printing on a package, I think on a package is going to be here.\nThat's right. This is not going to be shifted to some kind of digital data as the newspaper and everything has been shifted to.\nBut this remains real. And there are three processes of packaging or printing. One is offset, second is graduate, third which we are doing is a flexo.\nSo flexing is being a very new process and we say you still is a 30-40 year old in India.\n\n@8:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd it is a growing technology.\n\n@8:51 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo we, the, our first client gives up as a file. Let's say a file of a pamper. A child is sitting on a list or a designer.\n\n@9:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe design is being given to you.\n\n@9:01 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThe design is being done by the agency or the client side or the brand owner. They keep that design to us.\nBut that design has to be converted into the process oriented. Like if it has to be printed on a flexor, it has to be converted into flexor design.\nTo the need of the process according to the variables of the process. If it has to be printed on a graduate process, then the design of the commercial is totally different.\nOn the show. 3 of the processes are totally different. They need different tools, things, different variables are involved.\n\n@9:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe treatment is totally different.\n\n@9:42 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo now if the file comes to us, we will see it from the flexor graphic perspective. We have some input data.\nWe have to get less than if your picture of this wiki. You can see a picture of your office in a digital file and I have to print that picture on a paper.\nTo work like that, know, your paper. case looks exactly similar. Let's say we have that opera's picture on the opera's arrow head.\nThe brand would like that opera's picture to be real, like the period cut opera to be printed on this.\nBut there is a lot of effort and this effort is to be done by the all still the highest from our side, but that's fine.\nwe press file and we cut. So, that is our process. Right.\n\n@10:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, that's a part of the process. first part where you basically take a design and convert it to a flexor format, right?\nWhat's the other format or other steps after this?\n\n@10:38 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, one of the flexors, the file which is, if you have some printing background, the file is made up of different colors, right?\nBut that can be ripped into basic colors. every color is made up of a large series. So, you're using CMYK or what?\nto see either it can be printed through CMYK or even a special color. Also, I don't see CMYK or what are the color gradient that is a skill player.\nSo, our printing media will access the job. We will see the quality of the machine and the team can put many other parameters and would decide that this job will be printed in 4.5, 6, 7, 8.\nAnd after that they do color correction, then the file is separated into that store many colors. Yes, is printed in 4 colors, will be separated in 4 colors in different areas.\nRight.\n\n@11:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat is called ripping.\n\n@11:39 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, that is what ripping. So, that file is ripped into a different color.\n\n@11:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou know that dot.\n\n@11:51 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, every picture is considered of a small dot. We don't have a large storage.\n\n@11:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have some basic background about the printing industry.\n\n@12:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nsoftware and that dot further gets ripped into a small pixels. That pixels are then again reviewed or you know go for QC and we just we see what kind of a quality output is coming in something.\nEverything is go well then these findings go for hard imaging where these pixels are imaged onto a flexible graphic printing plate which is a photo polymer plate made up of an iron polymer.\nThen this those plates are through a process are imaged and that plate them goes for the printing.\n\n@12:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's that's basically the negative you would say for that image where you use that polymer sheet that you have created with the imaging and that sheet is used for printing or you have that file with this tested on the polymer and that file is used for printing.\nNow that file is imaged when it's after testing that file is imaged onto a photo polymer plate that file that's the embedded let's embedded onto a photo polymer plate and we have a erected image okay or the photo polymer plate this is through a process when you see the plate then it will come to know so that after that that plate is used for the printing Great understood and printing is done by you or some other computer you are not a printer you're not a printer so you basically are this pre-printing agency where the design comes to you you make all the changes you do the QC you do the imaging you do the plating and after the print has been done you give it for printing for the perfect perfect that gives me a very clear understanding thank you so much I really had no deep insight into this now in this entire process are we today using any AI in any way so now we are working with some software something like S4 okay.\n\n@13:56 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nS4 is one of the largest because company just got a software. where they have been working on automation, we are working on automation but it is not AI driven as per se, there are some automation but still a lot of human effort goes into it.\nIt has to be done by a higher skill person. So they say automation, if they have a kind of a profile meeting and put the file into it, it can be done through it.\nBut it has to be still decided by the print engineer. So basically you need a lot of domain knowledge to be able to find the same thing.\nunderstood.\n\n@14:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nso what I understand is that although we are doing automation but we are not using a lot of AI right now.\nNot actually. And what is the reason that we are not able to go to AI? it just because the domain knowledge is so eye oriented or so human oriented that we cannot go there?\nOr what do you think is the reason? No but I think that they happen to\n\n@15:01 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\ninitiative from the company, there is a lot of lot of focus on this, maybe there is only one company who has been sitting onto the pile of already developed software they just not go let it go or something, maybe that could be the reason, I think there is a definitely a lot of things which can be automated through AI, we can reduce the environment of human right as a kind of you know for the automation on the back of you know platform there are lot of things can be taken by AI, okay understood and is it like we are using AI in other aspects of the organization like HRM or thing other, nothing other wrong because this is something that you know I have seen a lot of employees of mine have started\nYeah, sending a very good return way, I know, because this is I think they are going to be challenging me to go right go, I that's good.\nThat's good.\n\n@16:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's good. That's a start somewhere at least but I mean that probably is so do you guys have to market as well go out in the market and market yourself or is it more like word of mouth where you already know the industry people know you and they come to you automatically.\n\n@16:30 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOh, you know, you cannot be have a Monopus situation when we ask to be visibility that there is a mutual kind of a thing when we happen in the industry being the largest player for so long.\nSo, lot of this comes directly to us but still we have to approach there is a team and a sales team, there is a double shooting team.\nThat's all we just that makes sense for both of us.\n\n@16:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd do the sales team use things like chargey-bick sector to create presentations or build staff through the coordination of the firm.\n\n@17:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOr do we even use this for reaching out to people?\n\n@17:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet us say there are 10 companies I want to reach out to. Is there some medicine? I'm not sure.\n\n@17:07 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI'm very, very, interested. Okay. I'm not using any kind of a state. All right.\n\n@17:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd do you think that something like this would help in the coming run?\n\n@17:18 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThat's an efficient vision for the vision for the company.\n\n@17:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's the next five years. you think this is? Picky, that is our target.\n\n@17:24 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nAnd as a company, we have been a strategizing to reduce the human burden. mean, because there is a lot of any competition.\nEverything has been so competitive. biggest component in other industries, human component, the kind of, you know, the family, which has a lot of pressure.\nAnd we have a, this is a special industry. There's a lot of, one of the smallest cat. Got it.\nSo, to have that kind of a consistency and to achieve these kind of tests each and every time. It is a huge effort to remain competitive to remain once ahead of the competition, automation and AI and these kind of things as one, one and only one solution in coming years, okay?\nI hear you.\n\n@18:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in what fields do you think that we have the low-hanging tools? example, we have the entire second that you start with that design and then we worked on it and the flow is a workflow that you do.\nIn between this workflow, what do you think are the lowest hanging tools where we can actually just go and get some quick returns or quick benefits?\n\n@18:40 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo I tell you like when we receive a file, so our people make a no the way to whatever feature, if the file is not red table then we send the file again to the client.\nOkay, we should see the file, make a drop bar allocated, if there is something wrong with the file and\ncan send them back to the to the mother or maybe they want to fire to be able to get back fire and get out it can be sent to them.\nSo these are the questions. I think these things can be easily achievable.\n\n@19:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right and how many times let us say out of 100 what percentage times do you actually send the file back manually 100 that is that is really a time saver in that case.\n\n@19:35 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nAnd that doesn't only require effort but also pile because then in the person we will have to get there happen one of these kind of things when the file is also you know received by my team there is one we we make a job card right this job part is manually prepared it is lot of time you know I have asked all mistake has a very big impact when there is some communication gap between the under\nkind of the main or you know some feature that that it travels till the last moment right maybe it may be into some loss to the country.\nSo, there are so many things which can be automated where we are you know when we talk about is one we are prone right two mistakes because we are doing multitasking every time we are not present at the at times with the same same amount of work.\nSo, this is human and we are looking forward that to make a really good optics to our next level company to be very comprehensive.\nThe automation and these kind of technologies are really critical in coming future for us.\n\n@20:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great. I missed a question. So, in terms of company size what would be our company size in terms of team and revenue?\n\n@20:51 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, you if we have two articles one is native graphics which is into pre-press flexor pre-press right. manufacturer flexor plates, the turnover is 100 crores of okay.\nAnd another is packaging company which is mainly into lamination and the panel should be packaging that is, that is a conversion algorithm you can start.\nSo, we are talking more about this prepress, this is 100 crores and we talk about flexor because we are mainly discussing in the real world flexor.\n\n@21:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow many people do we have roughly done in this? Starting size.\n\n@21:27 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nTalk about the whole of the organization we will have close to 400 people okay. And which can be reduced to a lot, a lot less number of people that is a target actually.\nUnderstood, understood.\n\n@21:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis makes a lot of sense. you said the first part that you can actually reduce right where you see low hanging fruit is basically job called handling and printing returns, correct?\nThey are you know in every process.\n\n@21:55 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nTalk about the content, there are a lot of people doing lot of that with the content still. It doesn't work that well unless until you have a person sitting and driving that in a very different way.\nNo, you have to drive that force every time there has to be somebody who is checking another one. This is something I just want to get rid of.\nWe have people on the people. This is something happening. If you see, there are a huge plethora of people.\nYou know, they are kind of... We will go out of the cognitive advantage. I understand.\n\n@22:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd that's not your core area. So you don't want to focus on it because it's not your core area.\nYou would rather focus on your core area and start working on that part.\n\n@22:41 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo if I go and employ somebody who will go into AI development or something, I will end up wasting a lot of time and energy and money.\n\n@22:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWithout even getting the right result to us.\n\n@22:56 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nBut it's not your core area. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. As a creative, are very, very much focused, that things we don't do, we just give it to the third party, we are only industrial doing, which can be covered in the revenue, we know, which we have got.\nMakes sense. Makes sense.\n\n@23:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, one part of this, what do you think is the second part, this will really greatly benefit from AI or something, in those accords.\n\n@23:30 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nWell, largely, you know, this is, we are talking about the business violence, so creating graphics has actually a requirement of this tool, second tool could be the color management, color management.\nSo, when we talk about the color management, we, the system, because we put lot of input and, you know, we, the system tries to simulate the press, know, because having applied play, then running under the\nand don't not get in the right kind of color, correct, the really big task and it actually results in a lot of losses for us and for the press and the loss of.\nSo, this can also be the help of AI, can be predicted well that this file will result in this kind of a actual print result and do it with this kind of things or this kind of a system.\nSo, this will actually would be a game changer because a company has been riddled with these kind of issues.\nare the two stresses where the every minute counts, is a lot of substrate, it goes into the mean, it goes for sustaining into the cause of manufacturing will go drastically low absolutely and we can see in advance that what is going to be printed, we still can but still there is a lot of that.\nSo, if they it goes can be done through artificial intelligence. Then definitely it could be a game changer. Makes sense.\n\n@25:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd what do you think will not be beneficial with AI? for Kuchy, as you know, by AI core, then the AI needs that.\nThis is something that really needs a human, cannot actually go and do AI. do you think? What are those things?\n\n@25:19 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, I think in today's world, where we are working towards a lot of new technologies, innovations. So, there are few things.\nOne thing is that we have been both day and night India, because that can definitely be done by artificial intelligence.\nthey have something to bring on artificial intelligence. I think largely these things can be done, but, you know, when it comes to human interaction, it's about building the team, it's about building the relationship with the client, and these, many other things can definitely not be.\nthat delegated to this sort of a thing. Other than that, I think most of the things currently. Awesome, awesome.\n\n@26:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat makes a lot of sense. that's where I've been talking to other CEOs. that's what they have also been relating to me on.\nSo now, other than this, in terms of, let's say, people management, or you might have some problems where people might get to you.\nAnd you are as a B2B, generally. So is it like you have a person always on call to handle problems and all?\nOr do you think that there is a scope in terms of, in terms of, say, a query resolution, or issues, what to answer from my point of view, as it's now?\nOr there are the two, three types of queries.\n\n@26:52 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOne is that is, because of the process, is that, you what is the status of play? It's, what, what the status of\nreach what is a eating a these are a lot of queries which can really go on a minute right the system we want either so many other thing which which means personal touch whether plan would like to know about the pie this is something he would like to say and would like to get some manual changes right you know these are things which which will take some time maybe when the mindset of the buyer also changes you know it will set these kind of definitely acceptable in near future but in the short term future I think this is to be quite efficient that that means a lot of sense and I really like your direction of thought there what I will do is separately I will try and schedule an interview or a conversation with you where so this is basically for the I will be the project that we were talking about but after coming in we will separately sit down and have a chat right probably go up more let's\nACTION ITEM: Schedule in-person meeting w/ Deepanshu in Delhi to discuss AI implementation for Creative Graphics (flexo pre-press, color mgmt). Msg on WhatsApp upon return to Delhi (~1 week). - WATCH\n\n@28:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmuch deeper in terms of what exactly is being done and what not. I have a basic idea now with this interview.\nWhere do you where do you guys work from? What's your location of work? No I don't.\n\n@28:12 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nNo I don't.\n\n@28:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOh great that's that's nearby I live in Delhi. So maybe one of these days I'll probably drive down and we'll catch up and we'll discuss this further.\n\n@28:22 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nPerfect perfect.\n\n@28:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nup here I'll give you my number. My number is seven three if you can drive it down.\n\n@28:30 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo I'm kind of right or the chat box list. Yeah I'm putting it on the chat board for you.\n\n@28:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is your Google Meet and I am putting on Google Meet. That's my number. You can connect with me on WhatsApp as well.\nSo I'm right now in there alone but in a few days I'll be back in and we can just schedule a call there.\nWe'll meet.\n\n@28:59 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI'll be I will look at what the process is on the ground, which company are working for? I do not work for a company right now.\n\n@29:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nam doing my research with IT Delhi. I am running a small startup which is still not out there. It's called my CPTO and this company basically talks to people and helps people who are either running their own IT team which is not able to do something or who do not have IT team and they want somebody to come in with expertise and help them do something right.\nSo, we work as an external technology team and help them out.\n\n@29:37 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nSo, quickly like we have been discussing that this is a kind of a strategy we are looking at. It's hard to go for this automation of the process and to somebody who is adapted over the basic knowledge of the main.\nIt can help us out and help you kind of you know the human effort and a lot of the human cause I would also say would be really really we have no greater answer.\n\n@30:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo, no worries at all the bunch you it's like because of the people who got sent out like he if he could have joined out there.\nSo this interview probably is that join where you require something and probably something can be done. So, no worries.\nLet me reach Delhi. will be there in probably a week or so. I will take and yeah, drop me a message on my WhatsApp.\n\n@30:36 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nThis number is on WhatsApp. Okay.\n\n@30:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI will connect with you when I am in Delhi and we will we will probably meet down at your place, right.\nHave a look at the entire thing and then we can pipeline on something.\n\n@30:47 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nOkay. So, can note down my number. is the fan show. Perfect.\n\n@30:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, looking forward a week is there are some queries you can\n\n@31:00 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nI think I have most of the things I required for the interview, but for helping you out, I would need a lot more data.\n\n@31:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's like very different from this interview. So let's catch up in person and let's do this sometime. So perfect.\n\n@31:15 - deepanshu goel (Wahren)\nyou so much again. you. bye.\n\n@31:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you.

        "content": "Vipin Ramani - February 07\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 27 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHey, you're doing No apologies needed the key I completely understand author in and specially India my my country my city my city is famous Now that we are talking about that I was in Delhi.\n\n@0:26 - Vipin Ramani\nI just got to go down to meet somebody And I had to go to golden temple flight linearly Flight was at six my brother said reach there at at latest by five And I and I'm looking at Google Maps and it's telling me it's gonna take 30 minutes, okay?\nSo I said for some reason I said chill 3 o'clock 315 I should leave And exactly what you were saying exactly the same\nWe were, I mean that 10 kilometers, we were stuck on the highway and when we actually reached after like R and 15 minutes to that spot, who think Gadiadhi bachongi, like 25, 30-year-olds, garam, hot blood, they're just biting each other, when you rode the plane.\nAnd then there are like 25 cars around it that are standing to watch and body. I mean, so I reached, they were holding literally the 5, I reached at 5.20, I mean, and at one time it's 30 minutes, I'll reach 4, and 15 minutes is what I'm showing, I'll reach at 6.\nAnd then somehow we basically maneuvered the driver through the back roads and we reached that like 5.20, I ran through.\nsecurity and all that and made it. So, I totally understand what you're saying.\n\n@2:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut apologies because...\n\n@2:07 - Vipin Ramani\nNo, no need. let's go through this. I might have to drop up at 30 minutes. I also will have to jump out quick.\n\n@2:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'll try to be pointy if you don't mind. So, I'm going to put through with the interview question and I'm going to walk along with that just to make sure that we record certain things which again, as I said earlier, what will be used or what will not be used will be something that you can take a call on.\nWe'll just...\n\n@2:40 - Vipin Ramani\nIf there's something that we are not able to cover or even afterwards, the question is not answered. Send me those questions.\nwill respond through an email.\n\n@2:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyou can try to solve it.\n\n@2:53 - Vipin Ramani\nYeah, sure.\n\n@2:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat works out but I think mostly we should be able to work with the this time frame. So before I start, I'm going to probably, I don't know if Google, no, but I'm going to share my screen, probably share a small image just to put the context in terms of what we are focusing on.\nSo I'm going to open this one image just to sit and you are already aware of this, just to put a tone in the right place, just sharing this image.\nIf you see this image, we have AI as a larger bubble that we have been working on for years, almost half my life I've been working with AI.\nThen we started with much in learning where we took the lot of data that was generated and then trained with supervised and supervised learning and we got things on right then keep deep learning right where we allowed it to use GANS and others to generate image and other stuff right so you guys for things like two-point medical where I did let's say cancer detection etc and recently in the last three four years we have been having a surge of generative AI right like chat gpt and video generation for sura and image generation right and our core focus would probably be only in the inner circle the generative AI that's that's there right this was just to set a context because we are both having a lot of a lot of experience on this and what happens is when we have lot of things that we have done and I loved I loved our chat last time because it reminded me of so many\nthings where I have been played around and your experience was so enriching, right? But let's narrow it down bit.\nLet's just narrow it down bit. And before we get into this, I will just ask some question which are more of aligning this into a statically statistical cohort, right?\nwhat industry and sector would you say the current companies that you're working with and into?\n\n@5:31 - Vipin Ramani\nSo there is some work I'm doing in aerospace, there is some in healthcare, financial services, and there is one which is more in HR.\nSo I would say those are the four, three, four areas that are already applying applications.\n\n@5:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat makes a lot of sense and that's a very very important for you to play around with. I don't know how you manage all those four together because as a leader managing all these four are really like challenging because they have very varied understandings.\nNow in terms of company size of employees and revenue and again you can choose not to answer the question if you wish to, but what would be a combined revenue in terms of mean revenue and in terms of number of employees that we have right now?\nSo my company or the clients, my company or the clients? Your company, our focus would be only on your operations in your company.\n\n@6:31 - Vipin Ramani\nI would say south of 25 mill, so 20, 20 to 30 mill then I know.\n\n@6:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWait that's that's awesome and the number of people that we have working on this segment?\n\n@6:47 - Vipin Ramani\nI would say 10 are permanent and then there are 10 which are basically fungible, the contract or the contract.\n\n@6:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, makes sense.\n\n@6:58 - Vipin Ramani\nparty.\n\n@7:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, that's a beautiful cohort to manage that amount of a number because a lot of people over higher and under the river, but this is great.\nThis is awesome. This is the perfect place where we want to be.\n\n@7:12 - Vipin Ramani\nLast week, last week I told you, right, KPMG, was saying that was the problem.\n\n@7:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, there are thousands and they can't deliver everywhere. only there, I I had the pleasure of working on the project with Apple.\nAnd while I was doing that, I realized that they have servers running for many years without anybody touching it.\nYeah, without knowing what is happening. Nobody knows what's there. They just don't want to touch because it might break something.\nExactly.\n\n@7:43 - Vipin Ramani\nNo bank, maybe I say that. Bank of America.\n\n@7:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, I can't the account of, I mean, we saved around $7 million just by understanding which servers shut up and shut them off.\nYeah.\n\n@7:55 - Vipin Ramani\nNo, no. Anyway, we'll go up. thing happen. Right.\n\n@8:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what amount of generative adoption and AI? This time I'm going to ask both the questions. In terms of AI, what do you think internally for the company, not externally for the customers, but for our operations and our products and our whatever we do, what is our AI adoption level in terms of generic AI and generative AI?\n\n@8:25 - Vipin Ramani\nSo generic AI, I mean, look, people like you and me, I've been doing AI. I mean, when I graduated, I wasn't calling a AI.\nmean, I, I don't know when I told you this, when I, when I hit it from your resume you said.\nSo when I get to Georgia Tech, I ran it at Georgia Tech. There were 10 professors who wanted to want me to come join them.\nNine of them said, come join me, but if not, go join any of the other eight, but not that guy, George.\n\n@8:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut George is working in AI and that is black magic.\n\n@9:00 - Vipin Ramani\nI mean these were, this was electrical and computer engineering so digital signal processing was coming up and computer chips and nanotechnology at that time and drones and all sorts of things and control systems were always the old basically 18 page theorems size like solving different but this guy, these guys said do anything but not join that and I said I'll join, only join that so that was the reason I went and joined, I had no idea about AI at that time and then I come on other day and again I mean there was nothing so then so I've been doing AI for a long time right when I was doing my PhD my professor told me this is the problem, reconfigurable controls of aircraft engines power systems and I went back and I said okay, solving all the permutations would run, I ran a small sample and said it will take 40 years and he said oh come back and 40 years to get your PhD\nSo, so then what happened is you always have to apply what it taught me is apply that business logic on top of the problem and then solve it now whether we we used to call and I the generative AI to me is very simple it's not really an extension or part because in those days I used to use sensor fusion I used to call it I used to call it solving for uncertainty how do I improve so there was there was chips that were coming from Chrysler they were they were who's one carated they were putting in their cars that were defective so they said we need to solve this on a floor so that we can fix it because sometimes the soldering is not right sometimes the solder is on the wrong side and out on the wire.\nSo, are connections that we blah blah blah and cars don't work because we will try indicator me book or pipers are not working and all that was root cause was chips.\nAs we applied infrared, we applied images and we applied current leakage and we would get data. And we would integrate all that information to figure out whether that board is good or not.\nAnd we were able to do it at 99.99, which is 6 sigma whatever. So to me that was generated, yeah, but we were doing it manually because we were like board guys, we would run it and then we would put infrared to it and then we would go take a video.\nSo we were then combining all three and it was Cluji, was, but in this day and age, they call this generator there, where basically there's an automatically, know, sensor fusion or high integration and then solve it.\nComing back to your question, because I'll be precise today, I will not talk too much because my anecdotes can, Vicki will go and bring a glass and say, I'll buy a bath cut there.\nKeep talking.\n\n@11:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe good thing is it's fun talking to you because there's so many things that are in common. So I'm sorry, I'm the pleasure.\n\n@12:00 - Vipin Ramani\nSo, so I would say now I'm doing maybe 25% maybe there is a middle ground of 15, 20% that is that people want to call it generated AI because their client is forcing me to say that because when I talk to them I say yeah, is you don't even need AI.\nSo, for example, one guy came, said we have 10,000 contracts, Grand Thornton and they had leases which were like 20 years old for equipment and buildings and all that.\nAnd he said yeah, there is a lot of garbage we can't figure out. And some are like, please go, what they have done is modified those may scratch, but it will be a contract information like rent will be this much and it will be from this day to this day.\nAnd there is nothing else is just signed on the right scribble like doctors prescription. So I look, we can do optical character recognition translated and come and create a document which will be very clean.\nIn fact, we can find your leaders and figure out which is where the intelligence is, what sure AI and your standard templates need to be, because what you have done is you have 500 templates for nothing.\nWe come a commercial industry to work with the company, so they said, oh, that'll be great. So we did that and now you wanted to call it general, like, which is the AI in any way, it's a optical character recognition, just reading and so again.\nSo there is that gray area where I say, don't use my name, but then if you want to sell it inside your company, my presentation will be how we are doing it, what we are controlling, how are we measuring accuracy, and how are we saying this is how things are so fine.\n\n@13:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI just wanted to add something there, which is something which is beautifully that you say that what I feel is that people have got a key called generative AI.\nand they're searching for locks. What they should rather do is find their problems that they want to solve and then use the key that should be done and that is one big problem that I'm seeing that everybody wants to run behind the latest technology, not knowing what it's going to solve.\nYou rather come up with your problems, share your problems and then let it be solved or whatever tool fits best.\n\n@14:22 - Vipin Ramani\nYeah, the same thing with AI again and it's now on CNN and when it's on CNN then every time they can already say I want to and I want to know AI and what they do is they go on Coursera who think and take a course with him and then they're like oh machine learning, I don't machine learning.\nSo anyway coming back to this, I think what happens is and I told you I think last time the bank I worked at, I mean you can call it a large fortune 50 bank but basically 90% of their AI projects\nIt was like a 4 billion dollar portfolio, 90% were calling AI but were not AI, so that gives you a sense.\nI, being more religious about it, we have to do, we have to pick up this, that's the right distribution I have.\nSo financial services may, where I come or I healthcare may, I think I told you last time there is some work that's going on, it's genuine, there is this interesting work going on in recruiting.\nSo what happens is people have built these computer vision, interview like a robot takes your interview. After the video, maybe it's a three minute or five minute video where the interview is happening and then basically there is an AI tool that analyzes the resume and now gives an output and then there is a Q&A that happens Analytical which is increasing order of difficulty and then bringing it all together and giving us code so There are two places that use cases that I'm trying to push that through one is One is for There is a big push for pushing people out of their What should I say out of poverty like first-generation students coming to college?\nWho don't know how to address how to what to wear in a interview? I mean, I you won't believe it.\nI've actually done some test cases with some universities They'll come with a black teacher and then goggles by baseball cap and a slouch And they're like and all you can see is they're phoned in above so then so what that computer that I like the computer vision analysis does is it gives them some on sentimental sentimental value some Basically on tone tonality some on all the various aspects, but it translates\nto back into English saying the stature, make sure lighting is good, make sure you're wearing light colored clothes, bright colored clothes and properly dressed and shaped and stuff and your profile should be looking good and then answer your questions directly without pausing without this blah blah blah.\nSo that's, so I've tried to go and tell it to the career counselors saying for those guys who have nobody at home or even the other students and their colleagues are different, hey look they might be helped by this so that they can actually do a good interview and then get out.\nThe other is basically for wear mask hiring, right? So I don't know that would be in India like Flipkart or Amazon India or Walmart.\nThey are hiring like a thousand, fifteen hundred people a day, but what they have is they take twenty-five thousand investments.\ndon't have the time, they're in bad medicine. I mean, otherwise they will have like 10 people interviewing continuously. So what this does is ingest all those 25,000 resumes, there is a filter, basically get to like for example, if you want to hire somebody in the warehouse, you want somebody who is not handicapped and somebody who can basically lift weights and do sort of other physical activity.\n\n@18:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you set up these set of rules and based on those rules that rules based engine can actually filter about which people you need it which don't.\n\n@18:32 - Vipin Ramani\nSo there is an integration, the challenges are basically where the interview is happening and the questions are the way the answer, things that they should have to pick up that context and bring it back.\nthere is some more to it. we are able to rank order the 25,000 and wherever they want to draw the line, it will like go get let me pick the past 100.\nSo their efficiency is improving. So what is what I mean to each other. And so that's\n\n@19:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nother one so those are the areas great that's that's awesome and I'm gonna jump a few things so I'm gonna come to this point where what do you think you have tried using generator way again we're focusing in a unit of air right now and although you tried and you did your level best you think that hey I was not able to achieve the desired results or the desired accuracy when it came to 50 60 probably 30% or even at 80% and I needed more accuracy and it just didn't materialize too what would be the use case for you so some of it is with in healthcare computer vision area I think there is still a lot of work and potential to refine it so it's just a question of time and repaint it versus having like giving up so that's where we are struggling\n\n@20:00 - Vipin Ramani\nThere are some MRI scans, CT scans for tumors, detection. I know there are papers and things that people have been able to do.\nI just think we are trying to go a bit more further and say, OK, three months before you can find, but can you find it six months or nine months before?\nso that's the challenge we're trying to. And then I think that what that need is to reduce, there are positives, which is the problem, which is we're using some fractals, we're using some AI, then that sense of fusion, right?\nSo genetic history, father's side, mother's side, grand talents, your genome. So that integration is taking a bit more time and it has also been a bit more noisy, which I can't call this.\nSo that's one area. The other area I think I told you last time, revenue sector.\n\n@21:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust bringing something in between there. So, there's a company called LinkPoint Medical, which used to be into cancer detection.\nI think I told you this last time that I talked. And we were able to do some really good work into Isofigal Cancer, where of your Isofigas could actually take all the images.\nAnd then through those images, we could actually detect if there's a possibility of a Barrett's Isofigas cancer or not, right?\nA barrier is an indicative of a cancer, not a cancer right now, but indicative yet might be coming across, right?\nSo, these are the good way where we could actually get good results, very, very accurate results, right? In fact, I was in US with the Boston Medical, I mean this with them for some time as well.\nIt's a beautiful use case and trust me with the right image AI algorithms, you will be able to hit gold on this one.\nAnd then because it is even banking on it.\n\n@21:58 - Vipin Ramani\nYeah. So, know that we are able to do after it's showing up in the x-ray or the MRI, the changes I'm trying to go further up and say 12 months before it shows up in the like I'm saying it's it's should it's there the signs are there the markers are there we're just not able to figure out whether or not naked eye because what I'm doing is I'm picking up the and the cohort is very limited because how do I find out the guy who's going to get tumor in 12 months learning data is very less that early data is missing so that training is limited so that's what I'm trying do this when the image is there yeah I mean a month before three weeks four weeks like that I can that is fine that is very accurate it's the going upstream and saying because that whereas that's why I need family history when did you have a heart issue when did your dad have been the heart issue are your behavior same how do you eating the same?\n\n@22:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nto provide the moment\n\n@23:00 - Vipin Ramani\nThen the other one is revenue cycle, basically I think I told you last time, the challenge there is, it takes time, there is a lot of, what should I say, there is a lot of Goda Garigakam like somebody needs to go through the 1000 page manual and the insurance guys are not making it easy, they start, I mean I'll tell you I just for one, one align, cardio, cardio, cardio, cardiology, basically some instructions will be on page 35, some will be on 175, some will be on 575 and some will be, they are made it, I mean it's like, imagine if you add the white pages and they put names randomly and you have to find your phone number of Nendoska, it's like you go through 1000 pages to find a number, it's like what are you doing,\nthat Mosaic or Yahoo had the Altaista search engine. They said, I don't, I'm sure you remember, they said, sir, should be on the third page so that we keep scrolling and looking at advertisements, which is the anti-theases of Google.\nThe same thing here. They made it complicated deliberately so that the hospital is not able to, so I said, look, automate that and just all that.\nNow there are tools and things. Create the rules based engine. In the E, make it easy for the doctor to just bubble eyes and make a video or a nurse, like what is the issue, what do we need, and then sort of bring it together so that the whole thing is very seamless for a consumer, for a patient and end-to-end and then your success rate on the insurance cycle.\nSo, we've, I've parted ways. the company because we were not gelling or whatever. Our approach was very different. I wanted to make this into a product.\nThey wanted to make it into a consulting. They had a 10-year roadmap. I had a 10-month roadmap. So as a TK, I don't have time.\nBut that's one area which is still near and dear to my heart that one day, if that happens, that would be great.\nSo that would that. Again, whether it's simple AI, genetic AI might be able to do it or even rule this or something.\n\n@25:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ngreat way, AI with something called RAG is able to do it very, very today. Exactly. So RAG, basically, and that also, if you would like to specialize a graph based ad would be an ideal use case for a case like this.\n\n@25:46 - Vipin Ramani\nYeah, yeah.\n\n@25:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nand looking at the time that we have only four minutes, two to three minutes.

Very good afternoon, Kenjana. Sorry, man. Girl, time pay, short move, this will be lovely, I have any luck.\nNo problem. I am down with fever, actually. Java, Kai. don't know what was expecting or something.\n\n@0:16 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\ndon't know what he was my third papa colica urgent came back, Gata.\n\n@0:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI just came back. That's my papa feeling? He's okay.\n\n@0:27 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nBut he has undergone two immunotherapy courses already. How is he taking it physically? We feel it is going in the right direction.\nYeah, let's see, the tube size has also gone down.\n\n@0:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI can't see my video, I don't know where it is.\n\n@0:51 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nIt looks like a ghost.\n\n@0:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyou see me? Yeah, yeah.\n\n@1:03 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nSo, I got down under the weather, it's a viral fever. My entire throat was, it became very weird, basically, felt as if something, some acid has gone in my throat, so today is the fourth, fifth day, basically.\nSo, more than one time, I'm heading back to work again.\n\n@1:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHe is basically, I have to be this, but I'm good. So, Kinyil-Arshwar, call address, this is not about our E3 65 work, this is slightly different.\nIt is about 3, it's about 65, but not about the work that we have been talking about, but it is somehow related to it.\nThis is an interview that I have been doing for research that I'm doing for IIT, Delhi. This research is about Gen AI.\nGen AI, I'm going to show you have heard about chat GBT, what about Sora, you have heard about AI generated videos and advertisements and all you are already hearing and seeing and doing some part of it as well, right?\nNow, the idea of this research is key on ground, what is the reality? Is Gen AI actually able to deliver something and what?\nAnd what is the way we are measuring it behind this so beneficial? Or is it like we tried a lot, but we have not been able to get certain things delivered, right?\nAnd I mean, why are you feeling and we can take it from there, right? So, that is a that is a topic of research.\nNow, I have a set of questions, some of those I already know the answer of, but for the recording, I will ask you those questions and you can probably put them down.\nSo, to begin with, What industry and sector would you say your experience about this, about the conversation coming from?\n\n@3:10 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nSorry, could you bring that question up again?\n\n@3:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat industry and sector is this information coming that you're sharing with me? This is even management industry mostly media?\nYeah, yeah.\n\n@3:26 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nMedia and entertainment you can say.\n\n@3:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, so even management media and entertainment, right? Yeah.\n\n@3:35 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nOr you can even put down live experiential, live experiential industry that is also better, because that pain points further down.\nPerfect.\n\n@3:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's a good way put a live experiential industry. Roughly what company size and number of size? That's not something I can help with yet.\nIn terms of revenue, are we talking about here?\n\n@4:00 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\ncompany size as in our company size.\n\n@4:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, employees are one side when you on the other side.\n\n@4:08 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nWe are a 40 to 50 member team.\n\n@4:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd the revenue roughly and you can choose to deny if you want to.\n\n@4:18 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nRevenue, revenue would be 40 to 50 CR. Top line, top line of the revenue.\n\n@4:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah.\n\n@4:27 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nBut this is so we are on record, I believe. This is including the disorganized sector also, which does not get.\n\n@4:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI will not put it up. This is only the segmentation of data. I'm not going to put it out.\nAnything you don't want me to put, you can just say that. Now, let's get to this in our industry and we are talking\nabout tangible returns so far right, intangible will discuss separately ok. Now, AI is a large group ok. Again there is a smaller group called machine learning right.\nMachine learning can there is a smaller group which is called your deep learning ticket or deep learning can there be bigger which is called generative AI.\nThey are all part of that gen AI. So, our focus of this conversation will stay on gen AI and not on a larger AI.\nRight. Now, up in the stream and from what you have seen and experienced. How is gen AI helping? it helping?\nIs it not helping? What is the biggest? in that you have seen from January so far in your industry.\nSee the biggest in is the democratization of something like a chat GPT where people are using it randomly left right and center to firstly make documents, text documents that has become very fast.\n\n@6:20 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nIf it is a proposal, if it is a draft, everything get get spend down in seconds and the usage of chat GPT is quite rampant.\nAfter that the visible changes that I have seen personally is the use of use of JNI in terms of images in presentations.\n\n@6:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nImage and video generation. Image and video generation in presentations in in pitch decks.\n\n@6:53 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nBecause that has brought down the turnaround time of some agency going back with a brief then working on the brief thing in their hard you know efforts and time preparing a very well elaborated date.\nSo this process has become stuck with JNI. So text, text pictorial images and also video images.\n\n@7:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have also experienced, oh not very rampant I've also experienced audio tunes being generated with JNI.\n\n@7:33 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nmy own team member had come up when our company turned 18 years old. My own team member had come up with a jingle about E365 and he created it in seconds.\nSo yeah so that once again is something which I have seen but once again that's not rampant yet. In terms of on-ground execution there is hardly any major change because it is majorly hard-wares driven and then it is human driven.\nBut here an MC, MC preparing a script for a corporate event has become very easy.\n\n@8:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that process has become easier.\n\n@8:26 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nPreviously an MC would require 3-4-5 hours to prepare a script. Then the client would do the proofreading and then there would be a backend for the discussion one or two days before the event.\nNow this process has become much smoother. In terms of musical performances there has not been any change on the ground.\nIn terms of other forms of performing arts there has not been any change.\n\n@8:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut in terms of visuals on the screen we have seen Quite, quite some advancements over there. In terms of the content that weges are using today, there have been, there has been a progress there.\nGreat. Great. Now, any one of these kids here. So, here are things that you mentioned, okay. You mentioned about document creation, proposals, etc.\nBeing the one of the most helpful things that is coming out of it, right. The second you talked about was image and videos, less of videos with more of images for the decks and other things that you present and you apply that, right.\nAnd the third was basically, in a way, it can be called a document, but the scripts that actually use for events, etc., which really helps because it reduces the time.\nIf you talk about tangible benefits, right, so imagine a proposal or a draft that you would made earlier before janei and after janei.\nWhat is the kind of percentage difference or resource difference or quality difference or I mean so many different ways that you can see the difference right.\nWhat are the difference that you majorly see in that?\n\n@10:16 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nI missed out on one point. We have also made operational plans using Chad Jippity.\n\n@10:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nVery good. I was waiting for that one.\n\n@10:28 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nYeah, we have also made operational plans as in the event flow, you know, sponsorship plan, the entire project plan actually we have made on Chad Jippity.\nThat has also happened. Now coming to the benefits, there are pros and cons both. Very good. I will start with the con because that is something which I have realized before I could foresee the pros.\nyou have stopped thinking completely yes we are we are from a creative industry we need to think we need to ideate that is completely stopped that's right okay whenever there is a brief whenever there is an opportunity of working on on an idea uh similar just going through their jemini or chagippity and and doing doing a small prompt and coming up with a solution but that is not the real solution so this is this is the this is why i myself had had not used chagippity for for more than two years now i still don't use chagippity from any of my direct accounts whenever i need to use it i i asked one of my colleagues to do the prompt and give me the report however i have started using jemini on a personal basis because it's sync with google and and stuff like that i have not given too much of data access\nto like whatever Google had access in terms of data from me, it already has it. Okay.\n\n@12:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nnow the pros, the plans are quite detailed and even junior resources can be trained faster.\n\n@12:19 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nVery good. When I say this, to manually train a junior resource by explaining the entire process No, uh, on a, on a presentation or, or basically going, taking them to the entire process, barber team has become easier.\n\n@12:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when you say easier, you take a number to a day, I used to take five days.\n\n@12:44 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nNow I used to take one day or I don't have any quantitative number as on to this date because I have not measured myself, but like I'm saying, it's like, it's infraction of a second.\nplan is ready.\n\n@12:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSomeone just has to go through it. and come up with questions it is that is you know and earlier vis-a-vis what are we comparing this earlier vis-a-vis say say I have to I have to myself draw down that entire plan manually it would take at least one or if not more so that is solved people have become faster but like I said I can see that they will become stupider they will not use their brain because the right brain would would bring out more creativity that is not to happen I think yeah so I think I think I have answered this question of yes yes so let us say you cannot comfortably answer because you didn't measure it but on the back of the envelope\nCongratulations let's say you spend one hour in making it then somebody sits down and drafts your thoughts right he takes another two hours he tries to get back to you and then he gets back what is the rough back of the end of time save that you think in brainstorming right comes from this time so if you have to look at a completely blank slate say for example we have a three-day confidence plan to make right and we are on a blank slate we have to start from the scratch and I did the entire plan starting from ground up so what would have taken us two days to build from the scratch will now happen in two seconds yeah but two seconds you have to go through it you have to read there will be you will still like to lie out yeah so from two days to twenty minutes you can put it like that okay\nSo basically that seems more realistic okay and when you talk about quality so you had been doing this earlier as well is there a major difference in the quality of churns so for example earlier I used to get good quality but that used to depend person to person right if the person has good knowledge he might give me good returns but if the person doesn't have good knowledge the returns would probably deteriorate as per the knowledge but now I mean even with lesser knowledge and lesser experience I'm getting better quality idea we're getting type cast to some extent okay possibly because of the limitation of data that has been fed to chat GPT as on today's date as we go ahead and as it gets more data access it will itself start churning out more more iterations of ideas so yeah it has got a con today but it will turn into a pro tomorrow you\nAnd one thing that I noticed is that earlier getting to customize a particular plan for a customer was difficult because in general, you would probably think of the planning and you work accordingly.\nBut today, if you need to customize that plan for a customer, all you need to do is create your plan, give it the customer details and say, can you modify this plan such that this customer has a very personalized experience and thing, then it can really get a turn around done on that, right?\nYeah, yeah. So I have to do the quality and what do you feel about the quality change that customer?\n\n@16:44 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nI don't have a specific use case where I can say that I have been able to measure X percentage of quality getting developed.\nBut say for example, for the, for customer. Nick Cutter project that we were working on for specific brands. Chat GPT helped us curate, you know, specific activation ideas.\nSo that happened from a customer to customer perspective. We had different ideas coming up.\n\n@17:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so you could personalize easier. Yeah, yeah.\n\n@17:27 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nSo how I can foresee as on today's date, it's very nascent at the moment. But going ahead, if the entire industry adopts to change, Excel sheets will be made only once in for an agency.\nAnd Excel sheets need to be updated as and when, so for example, just like just like a large organization has procurement department and they have a master Excel sheet.\n\n@17:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo similarly, we'll need\n\n@18:00 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nto update one master excel sheet possibly once a year and different activations from the excel sheet can happen as for the brief of the project where the entire costing you just have to mention that this is the number of packs this is the budget of the client this is the margin that I want to make and these are the three or four references that I need to give in terms of the visuals and stuff like that I think genii should be able to make the entire excel sheet on its own sticking to the profitability that the agency wants genii should also be able to explain that excel sheet through a presentation where the images and the video content will also be generated through through you know AI so the entire speech process can be automated I leave going ahead the team members have to\nto the implementation going by the going by what you know the presentation and the excel sheet says that's your aspiration from Jenny I thought hey there is it should be able to reach there and I should be able to get benefits out of it yeah I can I can foresee like like I had mentioned to earlier or earlier also I can foresee that if I can get you know the data of a bride and a groom in a very simple format like a slam book that we used to do back in the day Jenny I should be able to predict what like from their tests basically Jenny I should be able to predict what set design or what Varmala Varmala desire entry they would prefer on their on their D day right and my my execution team just has to go and replicate that design on the ground you know that makes sense\n\n@20:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmake sense. So, we have this this goes around well. What do you think that you have seen the industry try using JNI, but basically we fail?\n\n@20:15 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nTry using JNI, but miserably fail. There has not been so such an use case where you know JNI usage has come up to the execution level.\nThere have there must have been situations where you know predictive these things must have not matched exactly here and there.\nBut otherwise, some numbers usually come up which are absurd, but we can we can go through the sheet and we can say that these are absurd numbers that happens.\n\n@20:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, what you are trying to say is that there are times when while calculating numbers it just gives Is you out of the blue nonsense numbers?\n\n@21:02 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nIt gives an estimation which we can manually say that the estimation is wrong.\n\n@21:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. That that can happen here. So it is basically hallucinates.\n\n@21:14 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nIt will hallucinate till the time it has access to every data basic, I think. It will hallucinate because if you're asking a layman, you cannot expect specific answer auto-pressive specific in prediction to a probability.\nAnd you cannot expect that it will match exactly on ground. Yeah.\n\n@21:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEven with the possibility that because of the too much data it gets confused.\n\n@21:41 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nYeah. Because it is not a specialist in that domain. Absolutely correct.\n\n@21:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI agree. So what you want to say is basically, Genia is great at generalist task but when you go down specifically into specific things you will probably not be able to get good out of it.\nIt's not having that specialist knowledge.\n\n@22:03 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nSo the specialist, as for my understanding goes, the specialist still has to be the human brain for the next couple of years.\n\n@22:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut here the generalist task can be much easily done.\n\n@22:19 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nAnd they will take in taking more feed from our brains and develop their AI brain as well. So audio, audio would get better, images would get better, videos would get better, the numbers on excel sheet would get better, those things will keep on happening, but we also have to use it more often, we have to surrender to AI, I believe.\n\n@22:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI like that, I like that analogy surrender to AI, because that is what, that is what it is basically.\n\n@22:52 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nI'm actually, there was a poem by Shukumar Rai, if you know, it was called Kudur Kaul.\n\n@22:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nDo you remember?\n\n@24:00 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nEveryone starting from a 59-year-old graphic designer that we have, he has also started learning AI, how we can save time using AI.\nBut the adoption level is not as much as a 23-year-old young kid. The accountant who is not well-versed with any other technology and tally, he has also started learning how to reply back to an email using Chantupiti.\nYeah, I think more or less everything, every department has started using AI in some extent. But we have not yet done anything which is mandatory mandatory.\nFor that we need our project to fly off and then possibly we can do it mandatorily.\n\n@24:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I have heard all three aspects of this. have heard some companies say, this is important because if you are not doing it, we are losing to its mandatory, you should use it.\nThe second part that I've seen is, hey, I mean, as long as you do your work, I don't really care whether you use it or not, right?\nIf you use it, you can save time and you can have better quality, but another day I only care about my quality.\nAnd then there's a third view where people have said that, hey, you've become too dependent and complacent. You've got so many spending mistakes or so many media mistakes, right?\nI do not want you to use chargeability. Whatever you do, the final result has to come through and it has to be non-julptivity.\nSo there are three different views.\n\n@25:34 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nWe are currently at the mid-level, you would say.\n\n@25:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we are encouraging people to learn AI.\n\n@25:42 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nMaybe going ahead, we will try to enforce more of AI. It has to be at the task level, basically.\nOnce we can, we can get a direct correlation between...\n\n@26:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\neven how much time which department can save and how so correlation has to be there which is still missing but yeah I think we are at the middle level now and in terms of training do you refer to say hey you go out and figure out on YouTube or wherever online tools you get or do you increase the behavior you bring the project that everybody can attend or a seminar or a class and then we will we will sponsor it or we will push it what is your level of pushing to AI for your employees?\nSorry I was getting a call anyways yeah like I said there have been one or two cases\n\n@27:00 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nwhere we have had one instance being you addressing the team together on the on the future of agency and now AI will you know empower us.\nWe have done two or three such town halls individually a lot of people depending on what job roles they are in.\nWe have made them do courses on AI separately but that has not happened across the board. So yeah so it has not been standardized yet like we don't have a single code that everyone has done that has not happened but we have had people doing specific courses as and when required.\n\n@27:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's a need based driving that we are doing and I mean it could be. Yes. Great. And I mean, on ground, on ground in reality, if you would say, hey, Jenny, I saved me $1,000, 5 lakh rupees, 10 lakh rupees, time quality, what did Jenny, give you so far?\nAnd again, the truth is absolutely fine, just on the ground, what has Jenny, have given you so far? I have not measured it yet.\nYeah. And I mean, in terms of, let's say if we skip measurement for a minute and we close our eyes, the first one that you said was, hey, it helps me write documents and prepare them fast, right?\nThat's the first one that you gave me. Is there a number idea that you would have? I let's say, hey, over the top of my head, the back of the envelope.\nuh calculations this is how much I save out of it roughly say for example my uh I don't have a content writer in the team anymore okay great so that's what's already reduced yeah uh I don't have a content writer in the team the the strategy planning team it can themselves do the content writing today very good that is one thing social media team does not have someone to help them with copies so content writing copywriting these two drops are gone okay so that can be an indirect tangible uh savings that we have made again the taylor group is a year you can put it easily gone out of the don't need it anymore and the quality i'm also improved with that or is that like we lost people but the quality is not improved it's like similar than earlier or better worse\nI don't like automated texts myself because the human touch is missing so quality is very subjective to me if you ask me I don't is missing yeah yeah but that could be a technical part as well because if we are managing the customer's data on on let's say one document where you keep sharing your emotion and how you feel about it and you keep putting it down somewhere we can actually use that to make the communication that way directly changed to you yeah yeah possible right great\n\n@32:00 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nWe knew we with Owens, we ourselves were doing a lot of things in terms of expectation to be AI and J&I.\n\n@32:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut yeah, I think if you asked me on hindsight, we could have or we should have changed our day-to-day processes across departments.\nThank you. Excuse me. My daughter is writing me a lot later. That is the best thing that can happen in the world.\n\n@32:52 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nI have been locked up in a room for five days. It is ati bohar, she gets two more cards, she will get access to me, direct access to me to more onwards, she will get two, it will be with it will be with me.\n\n@33:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, second opinion question is, in your opinion, is the most motivating success study, are you sure me? Tell me how you you are frozen, show me again.\nOh, she's writing, I love you. Mine writes on my hand, this belongs to me. Yeah, so the question was, what is the most notable success that you have seen so far?\nmost notable success event that might not be in your organization may be out. It offered when you say here, sub-symbol I'm like, this is the biggest benefit that anybody could have got out of it.\nWith JNA? Yeah.\n\n@34:17 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nI think I saw in the hospital where my father is getting treated. I saw they have built a lab, basically built an operation theatre where robots programmed with JNA are basically doing surgery on real patients.\nAnd they are claiming that the precision would be much more than a human doctor.\n\n@34:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's deep learning. That's not JNA is deep learning. are using deep learning to do this, which is very, very, very precise because they have learnt from all the operations that have been done by the doctors, so it's really, really nice.\nYeah, this is something that came came to my mind, but otherwise if you ask me But I asked him exactly That's right Some companies have done away with that Total support team, no support required L1 support totally gone because L1 support is not required anymore, right?\nJenny, I can answer questions, it can even answer your phone calls, you can do all those things Then for some organizations, like for example your organization, copywriting is fully gone, right?\nThen in some organizations, even coding has reduced drastically around 60 percent including has reduced right so in your head what I think is the most notable success that the world has got because of this idea.\n\n@36:13 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nI think all political jobs.\n\n@36:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you. you.\n\n@36:26 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nyou that's beautiful.\n\n@36:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAll the clerical jobs are gone majorly. You, you want to say Those are one last span and these people obviously will learn a specialist drop, some specialisation they will learn and develop themselves which I think has become holistically it will uplift people.\nI agree with you, I agree with you. The last question, Angel, and thank you for being so patient, is what is your recommendation for any company that is trying to do a digital transformation using generative AI?\nWhat is your recommendation with your knowledge, whatever you have?\n\n@37:49 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nSo certain things which we learnt over the last one year with you guys, adoption has to be faster, we were very slow.\nbecause we were apprehensive in a lot of things adoption has to be faster because the industry moving at a very fast pace in terms of the result that is going on and frankly speaking two three years back we were contemplating whether to at all allow AI into our lives or not that is no longer no longer an option so maybe we lost time there as well in contemplating whether we give access to AI or whether AI will make things much more mundane and blah blah blah I think we have to be very fast in adopting to AI and specialists have to train AI\n\n@39:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you have seen the process that we want to build between bandage, if the process really is there, we don't need 100 member team to do a 100 crore or 300 crore rupees business.\n\n@39:16 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nWe need a team, but especially steam to do a 100 crore business. So that is the potential that I can foresee.\n\n@39:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe need human executions. The planning part can gradually shift to AI, provided someone knows how to train and control.\nYeah I think operationally a lot of things will change.\n\n@39:46 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nThe special installed talk and then execution level at the very back end.\n\n@39:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYour recommendation is that have somebody specialise leading your genii efforts. That will get you there faster and better. You don't go for generic solutions and general stuff.\n\n@40:07 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nYeah. Which is fair, which is fair.\n\n@40:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPerfect. Thank you so much for this time and interview. This will be part of your strategic project. No, no, no, This is separate.\nThis is for my 3B HD research that I'm doing. Actually, you are doing another course with IIT Delhi? No, no course.\nThis is a 3B HD research paper that I'm writing. Okay. What the people doing? What are they doing? After their situations?\nYes, actually they work. They're all back to their respective works. Everybody is in their own area. Hard to get in touch with everybody, but everybody seems to be busy.\nRight. Yeah. About your message. went through it. And while am for it, it's not time like I have been there because somebody has to dedicate it to the time.\nIt cannot be done, peace me. I mean, let us say that it's dedicated to time, but that time has to be taken out and given to get to a level where you can put it phase by.\nSo the way that it'll be done is the theme part, that part, that is why it'll be done. Don't say what it will do.\nyes, I'm that I will to take it out, whether I'm a the way it be done part. the part, price.\nwhy price. and then we'll this.\n\n@41:57 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nKick, kick, kick. Jenna?\n\n@42:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I mean, if we can probably have this, let me see if I can take out time, right? If I cannot take out time, then let's see how it manages out.\nmean, within this week, probably, my poetry shall work. I can give you something, at least, in terms of my time and how we can plan that out.\nSo, case you are thinking about that, should start in informal conversation that, hey, Uncle, would you be open to me?\nYou want me to start it or you want to start it? At your end. Either way, skin will just look comfortable as I can do it.\n\n@43:00 - Kinjal Bhattacharya\nHis name came up to my mind very sporadically, because as a reference, not as a candidate or say, but as a reference, that someone, someone who can basically, his job does not need to be in any of the materials or be related to me or what the other directors are doing.\n\n@43:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt has to be a full-time job, it has to be full-time job, that is very, very important, and that is what is going to make a difference, a big difference, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSo, I can initiate, let me have a word with him and figure out if I am interested in planning here and how we can take it from there, that is the basket that I to it.\nSo, I will take care of the food and I will have conversation with you later, thank you.

        "content": "Transcript\nArnav Mukherjee - March 05\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 42 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have been in the industry for around 27 years, working with multiple technology roles and leadership roles in technology.\n\n@0:09 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nRight.\n\n@0:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis particular interview is for research that I'm doing with IT Delhi. Okay. The research is basically focused on Gen AI.\nAI is a very big column grid, but AI is a very small piece out of that entire big AI bunch.\nAbsolutely. What we are trying to figure out is that everybody right now wants Gen AI, right? Everybody wants it right from the boards to the developers to everybody is looking at, hey, I want Gen AI, right?\nCorrect. But how much on the ground is it beneficial? Right. Right. how much on the ground is it not that great?\nAnd we want to talk in terms of tangible knowledge, not in terms of concept because concepts are flowing all around.\nI have been in the industry in terms of Gen AI. here now and I have created a lot of different tools for those generic solutions.\nSo in general, we all know, but in specific in what you do and what are working on, what are those aspects where you see tangible results or tangible failures, right?\nThat's basically the core of what we are focusing on.\n\n@1:20 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nAbsolutely.\n\n@1:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, I will start customizing with what industry and sector you can categorize the work you are doing into.\n\n@1:32 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo we are in the IT consulting and software development industry. We are into complete business automation for startups, for small to medium size enterprises.\nRecently, we have also expanded our services to cater to larger organizations. So yeah, we have also worked with companies such as the Metavus and the Google Cloud Red.\nSo we left its bare tools to provide solutions. our customers.\n\n@2:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in terms of companies, how many employees and revenue will you be targeting at? is to segment your feedback into the right limit.\n\n@2:13 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo in terms of revenue, in the last, I say, five years, the last two years that have been in the world, years where we have the maximum revenue, that is about upwards of, let's say, three to four million dollars.\nThat is currently our business. In terms of size, I'd say we have a team of about 50 people, and most of them are contractors.\nSo it's like freelance and we also have people from Google who are working on this part time, right? that is, you know, things like that.\nYou also have interns who drop in to provide some new ideas from universities like Harvard, Stanford, and when IIT is for that matter.\nYou did. Yeah. Awesome.\n\n@3:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nspecifically talking in terms of your business and what you are doing, what has been the biggest win that you have had with Jenny so far?\n\n@3:19 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nIn terms of win, I'd say that it helps us if it was done or it doesn't Right.\n\n@3:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm sorry, I'm cutting in there. Yeah. Yeah. The idea is to understand tangibly the benefit or the problem it is solving and in terms of revenue or time save or effort save or whatever tangible benefits we have, what is the kind of benefit we're looking at, right?\n\n@3:43 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nIn terms of tangible outcomes, I'd say that our renews have been able to scale because our execution time has gone down because of the automation that we are trying to bring in leveraging.\n\n@3:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah.\n\n@3:59 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nRight. So, I'd say our productivity levels have got up by about 30%. Wow, that's good. And in terms of, like, the existing, the final, we brought down by a project took a week to complete.\nWe were able to complete it in a day. So because, like, let's say, I have had a coding, for example, finding bugs, tools like GPT have been able to, you know, help us find bugs easily.\nAlso, you know, it has also helped us with, you know, figuring out the, you know, plans, right? So let's say if I want to set up a timeline for something, it has been useful to help us plan our projects better.\nSo that is how I'd say it's been able to help us. Right.\n\n@4:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo this, again, is on a wider node. Let's specifically try and see. So out of these, I heard. automation, I heard help with development, I heard help with planning, help with debugging, these four things I heard.\nNow, if we go, if we select one of these, what do you think is the biggest benefit given to you?\nit automation? it core development? it debugging? it planning? Which part is the biggest benefit to you? Planning, planning. So, when we talk about planning, now let's go a bit deeper into planning.\nChat GPT can help you do planning or any element tools can help you do planning and you will have to put a lot of different guardrails around it.\nwill have to put a rack tool or whatever works best for you in terms of your proprietary data to be used in planning, right?\nCorrect. What kind of benefits have you seen in planning? is the tangible benefit that you have seen in planning?\nit like, oh, I don't have to go through it or is it that I still have a human in loop, I still review my plan but yes the time is still reduced.\n\n@6:16 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nRight, so let's say the human planning can be done right, so that has been brought down to a day because a human is sitting in his you know plan using a generator model, right.\nAlthough there are some things that always we treat with respect to our systems, Our systems are not capable of executing that plan in the given time frame that the LLM model or the generative AI, what we say is suggesting, right.\nSo we take it as he's suggesting this, we can do it in this, what's the best way in which we can execute this entire plan, right.\nSo in those terms I believe thing which we can come up with. Up with GPT, what has happened is, Mysbogar Bhutavakya, Planle Kiai, Pelevo, Apnakutkaikarafskeptyasavrathai, he feeds into the model.\nHe make it professional, come up with a proper timeline with, you know, kiss time to Kiamunachaya, and what is our, you know, buffer time, right?\nMost of figure out Kanne Kili, he's using that software. After which, we sit and review it, we review Katamu Jatai in the next, you know, or two hours because we are able to figure out with the data is presented in a way which we are able to use, know, and it's easier to read compared to that mind map and concept map that we used to work with in the past, right?\nSo, it, the, you know, the presentation of data has become better with the health of these models, and that helps us, you know, figure out better alternatives, you know, that helps us with execution and plan.\n\n@8:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, what I understand is that it's not only the brainstorming that helps you, but after brainstorming, The way of presenting that data has become better because it's just easier to present it in a better way, right?\nGreat, so planning is one I called. What would be the next rank after planning that really? So you said the best benefit that you have got 10 Gb is three days is two, let's say one day roughly, right?\n\n@9:20 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nOne and one and a half day, about 3% let's say it's gone. Right. what's next after planning?\n\n@9:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nit like development? Is it like debugging automation? What's next?\n\n@9:32 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo I'd say data may be, you know, it's helped a lot for structuring our data, right? Structuring that data into, you know, what an organized fashion.\nLet's say before, let's say we were using Google drives and all these other softwares to organize our data, you know, keep all the files in place and everything.\nNow if we build something as a rapper on GPT and then run it to, you know, sort our data, that helps us to, you know, all.\nrecognize that data for that client and present it to that client faster than what we wish you usually doing like all these emails and all that that have gone down because the CRM soft guys have gotten better and the ERP has also gotten better that has helped us with our internal planning as well right all the data analysis part I'd say it's been able to help us with especially if you're building on the generative AI not just sticking to what it's saying that is tangibly what about of like earlier you said it's a time save right three days to one day which is like a 60% time save roughly right in terms of structuring data what exactly do you save is it time is it money or is it process that the efficiency boost I'd say that what we get about 25 to 40% efficiency boost by providing reports and all that that is already generated\nAI, right? I was working with this company recently in furniture manufacturing, right? And they have automated a lot of manual processes like paperwork and all that using artificial intelligence in, you know, and generated AI.\nAnd that has helped them, you know, be able to track data easier. They are able to figure out how much time their workforce was usually taking and how much time they are taking now.\nThat contrast, what we measured, was roughly about 25 to 40% boost, right? That is in terms of time, as well as in terms of money, because the more time you're saving and giving to the client, the more money you'll make, right?\nBecause you can go to higher prices and be able to do the same thing in less time, right? Perfect, that makes sense.\n\n@11:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwhat would be, so one, the best solution that you got was planning. And that gave you around a 60% boost in terms of saving time and again, time is money.\nthen you said the next best thing that we got out of generative is structuring data basically, and presenting it forward further.\nThat really helps and that saves you around 25% and gives you a 25% efficiency boost. All right. What would be our next and probably the last in this series?\n\n@12:30 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo if I had to say with also with the people's efficiency, you know, mind power, right? So Jupa, Jupanda Karmkar, right?\nyou know, let's say, coding code, etc. Now let's say you explain the code and your building simultaneously with the generative AI.\nThe AI understands the code and you understand the code. It's like a mutual relationship. And what happens with that is you are able to save upon the efficiency of the worker.\nSo that person is able to, you know, probably save, you know, maybe more than 50% of his time because of simultaneously working with an AI companion with him, right?\nSo what kind of a tool set would you be using?\n\n@13:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGo pilot, go pilot. We will also be using predictive things now.\n\n@13:35 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nLike, you know, you can ask the AI to generate that code. So there are these softwares that have come in the market which you've got custom made.\nAnd these softwares, what they do is, when you're writing code, you explain the project to the AI once and the AI helps you predict in what fashion should you be structuring that code, right?\nAnd how should you be, you know, writing the code for maximum? efficiency and so that the areas are less when you later go on to build more on this side.\n\n@14:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut that is very generic and in terms of like knowledge, this is something that can be taken up either by the research knowledge that somebody wants to have.\nIn specific, how would this help somebody, mean, reduces time? Because this is something which is like, you're getting knowledge and knowledge, this knowledge was also available before GPT, right?\nIsn't that the knowledge become accessible? Is that one of the reasons?\n\n@14:30 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nIt has become more accessible because of the wider strength of the, know, more and more people using it. Because change management is something which was really hard back in the day.\nCreate has become more easier because, you know, let's say even if my developer needs to learn something new, right?\nI tell him that you go and ask GPT how to, you know, learn the software best. He's able to figure out what to, you know, do in order to learn that software better.\nAll that, you know, change management has become easier. We are able to, you know, reach more and more things to our developers.\nThat is helping us gain more efficiency in terms of numbers. I'd say right now, because we have recently just started, you know, embracing all that.\nIt'll be about 15 20 percent increase, right? Not that clear as of now. Right.\n\n@15:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthe problem with using such tools with debugging, and I mean, I have been doing this for a long time.\nYeah. Is that most of these tools are very limited in the size of things that they, or the scope of things that they look at, the blast radius is very small.\nYou might go and say, I want a function which does this. Great. They give it to you. But the moment you say, I want a UI which has a backend, and has a database and...\n\n@15:46 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nThat's why there's still human interference that is required. It's not that advanced, then which, you know, time it is developing as what we have seen.\nYou know before let's say your image recognition and all that is not possible for AI and nowadays It's easier to you know recognize things and you know figure out What is the gaps?\n\n@16:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nso Those are the things in which I believe it has improved and will improve with it right and If you look at the worst failures where you say hey, I tried this out it lost money and it was utterly used You just use off Jenny I what would that be?\n\n@16:34 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nI'll have to think in a minute Right so in terms of where I lost money Before what we were doing is I see losing money.\nWe were creating a comment for everyone Subscriptions and all of those one part.\n\n@16:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, but in terms of usage of Jenny Hey, I tried to use generate to do X. And I mean, although we had a good expectation out of it, it wasn't failed and we couldn't get it done.\n\n@17:08 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nElton Kessarthwatha, I should not be saying this, we were working with Hilton Pro software. I think one is about certain copyright issues and, you know, there was a lot of misinformation which it had provided in the coding process, which it did not pass certain certifications because that, you know, and we were in a hot soup with Hilton when we presented that software to them because their QC team, you know, figured out these loopholes very quickly because, you know, they have been doing it for a long time.\nAnd, you know, I think we were working on room occupancy and turnover, right, how can get people to stay in hotel rooms longer than required, right?\nSo, we were working on those things, there were certain gaps which we had used AI to fill up, but then it was not as efficient, but then yeah.\nIt did not want us about certain things that were actually copyrighted, but then just gave out that information we thought we can use it.\nWe would have gotten into a hot soup, but then I think they were kind enough to understand that, you know, with the developing firm, it is, you know, challenges exist, right?\nwe were pardoned off. I mean, it could have been worse, but then we were glad to know that, you know, this is also a possibility in which should not just blind you to like, you know, on Jenny.\nRight. Right.\n\n@18:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's, that's always the case.\n\n@18:34 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo security threats and all that, that keep coming up, right, because cyber attacks and all that. So let's just, how many else is also using an AI to crack your code, right?\nTo figure out, to bypass those security systems and out, you know, where we can actually hack the system and get into it.\nThose are the things where it gets risky to trust AI randomly, because I've been made out of laparas, bad cake.\nHe will know how to protect it properly, but now if I go and tell him you blend it with air and then you write it, he will have some amount of knowledge gap, right?\nAnd he will not know all the things that are happening in that software that could potentially lead to cyber attacks and that could increase the property of you know, you know, securities and all that going into threat.\n\n@19:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have a very interesting thing for this element, I am hearing you and what I am trying to figure out is, I am not relying a lot on AI for these things, for these things in the past we have relied on experience, right?\ndevelopers who are well versed with what security issues are, what not and they develop the code and they manage it.\nWhat is it that we are trying to achieve out here? Are we trying to fill in the experience developers who know this with non-experience developers plus AI or what is the\nThis is a stake here.\n\n@20:01 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nI was hard on network out. I'm sorry. Yeah, so it's loss on network. Normally, I repeat.\n\n@20:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's an interesting, interesting conversation that I'm having, and I'm trying to understand that normally senior business developers or my bad, sorry, normally senior software developers were used to make sure that these security loopholes are taking care of and all these things I've taken care of.\nWe have checklists that we used to follow and all that.\n\n@20:34 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nWhat is the business take here?\n\n@20:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIs it that we are trying to take younger or less experienced developers and augment them with AI? Is that the business case?\nOr is it that the developers are not knowing the security hassles and it's still able to break? I didn't get that picture there.\nI'm just trying to.\n\n@20:53 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo right now, if you look at startups, I'm not talking about MNCs, I'm looking at startups, right? they usually go out and hire junior developers and say developers to save on cost right and they believe that if we train this guy you know and we combine him with AI we could achieve the same amount of output as a senior developer they majorly do this to save upon costs but then the problem here comes that AI always it doesn't always give you the same you know type knowledge that a senior developer would possess you know possess because they have a certain mindset that they have developed by you know actually fighting a lot of code and you know a lot of problems in reality when you look at junior developers using AI trying to achieve the same output as a senior developer you'd always find across that they have some amount of gap that does not give them the same amount of qualification as a senior developer but later on you know that could be a threat right because\nLet's say a senior developer today he has been working at let's say Microsoft right for the last 20 years of his life.\nHe would have a certain mindset and he would know certain knowledge about fighting these security battles and your copyright issues and whatnot, right?\nBut now let's say if I say there's this one guy who has just walked out of college fresh, and he's trying to start his career.\nHe's worked one year with one of these smallest perhaps and now he wants to come and work in my company.\nI want to create this revolutionary product which I'm planning on selling to some big M&C, right? And he is trying to use AI to build upon his knowledge to take it to the next level.\nBut then what the thing comes out here is that he's not having the same amount of knowledge, like actual knowledge about the owning else.\nHe has some amount of knowledge with respect to these copyright claims, but then it is not the full picture that could potentially leave.\nto threat to the company. And that would also potentially help you damage your reputation. lot of qualitative factors also come into picture where your business could be sued, right?\nWorst case. And fighting those claims could get you bankrupt, especially as a startup. So those are the things which we are looking at.\n\n@23:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo yeah, that makes one sense where we are probably trying to bridge the gap of let's say experience with Genii and that doesn't work, right?\nBridging the gap of experience is one problem. What are the other major problems that you see while using Genii in your organization?\n\n@23:44 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo we actually, I'll be honest with you, we will not use Genii a lot. We build on other models and then we try to provide solutions, like customized solutions with respect to the business, right?\nThe startups I know right now, I think, I was conference last weekend. We had met these group of AI enthusiasts, right?\nThey had these startups and the majority of them we could look through was a wrapper of GPT 4.0, right?\nThey're not actually adding value to, you know, developing more on AI. They're actually building up servers all around the existing things, right?\nAnd they're in the market for quick profits and whatnot. But let's say if I had to integrate AI, right?\nWe would have to come up with, you know, what people are doing right now, they have these large language models, right?\nThey have, you know, a lot of data which is unnecessary and they're still feeding it. So if I want to let's say develop something for a, you know, construction company, right?\nThe data what I would require is that of a construction database or, you know, things which are related to construction.\nAnd not just, you know, what else do I say, random knowledge that is just flowing around the market, right?\nThose things, I think, helping it build specifically on particular domains and industries is what we are facing challenges with, because people are not working on that side of things.\nThey are looking at a wider perspective, and most of them are just trying to exploit the existing systems to, you know, leach of them, that is, you know, something which should be in case.\nI totally agree with you.\n\n@25:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt has been about five years now, but I've been working with Gen AI solution development and all. And very recently, I don't know if you're aware of that company, simpler, but they hired me to get this, this organization straight, so they had a lot of developers who are already working, we have entire teams working on it.\nI was hired to make sure that this goes in the right direction, because they had not been able to deliver.\nSo, yes, a lot of people are trying to get into the But end of the day, if I would say, you would be developing for other people, but when you are using in the organization, I mean, there are tools for HR management, right?\nThere are tools for your developer assessment, there are tools for supporting your customers, there are tools for doing marketing and reaching out to customers, I mean, there are so many different AI tools, right?\nWhy would we not be utilizing it because of scale that we have not had that scale that we really needed?\nIs it because these tools are not worth right now or I tried it but it worked very well?\n\n@26:41 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nIt's not really effective, I'd say, you know, when you're saying out, you know, I've seen these companies, they use these cold outreach campaigns, right?\nThey targeted your customer segment and, you know, they try to conduct cold outreach, but then the response rate and the execution.\nof what they are trying to do with these companies. The marketing aspect goes for a downfall. Majority of my business still comes out of referrals and not due to outbound marketing.\nInbound leads are something which helped me grow faster compared to reaching out to hundreds and thousands and millions of companies and offering them my services because the concept of niche that dies out in the is also being handled by the engineer at the first level at least.\n\n@27:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhen you basically take the data and then somebody some human can pick up and take it from there.\n\n@27:38 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nCorrect so when we pick up data we have these things that are right now my friend was working with us you know IIT student I think on what do you call it cold outreach calls right.\nThey have these outsourced companies where they reach out to the AI and then they try to figure out the problems but then it's all very scripted.\nThere's no you know. AIA has not reached a stage where it is actually comparable to a human, right? Human's way of thinking and the way AI thinks, you can easily currently make out that, you know, there's a difference, right?\nThat scriptness, you know, it's trying to get some information of, okay, there's that personal touch as what we call that is locked.\nAnd, you know, the conversion rate, I'd say if I put a human at work today and an AI at work, the human would probably, if he's skilled enough, he'd be able to, you know, pick up more clients and convert them faster compared to, you know, let's say someone else from maybe, you know, who is not working, sorry, an AI,\n\n@29:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI see a I see a diversion here right and again it might be just my way of understanding but you can clear that out for me.\nIn marketing we are saying that human versus AI right AI cannot do better right and again we are not dividing into planning reaching out what is the right information to first I mean put forward doing research of the person we are not breaking it down into the same way but in development we are seeing the opposite way where you're saying hey AI is augmenting our developers and giving it benefits is it because on ground we have not tried it out here or is it because you tried it out and tangibly you saw that there's no real benefit out of it right\n\n@30:00 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo, systems and processes, if I say AI does a good job with that, but if I look at personal touch and building relationships with customers, humans do it better.\nYou'd always trust a human more than a robot. Not in terms of, not talking in terms of surgery, accuracy and things like that.\nI'm talking about trusting a company. You would not, you know, we all hate IVLs today because, you know, they are all scripted.\nBut then, let's say if I actually put an effort to find out what your real problem is, AI would try to force some things when you're just to close the deal faster, right?\nBut then, it's a human would actually try to understand it, process it and then figure out what would be the best possible solution we can offer you.\nIf we can't do it, probably just cut the cut, right? So, that is more efficient is what I believe.\nIn terms of development, if I see, development may, some things are standard, right? If I look at a developer today, if I have to train him and AI could train him possibly, but then it is because certain things are just set, they are rules and he can find the most efficient way to come out of it.\nBut when I look at understanding a customer's problem and finding solutions to that, I believe that humans would be better at that.\nThat is a might, but for that.\n\n@31:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, today in the organization that you are working out, are you planning to use AI in terms of HR or other activities, other marketing and development?\nIs that?\n\n@31:39 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nWe are a little too early for implementing HR strategies, although we have a human who know does all this right now because, majorly, it is contract based workers.\nlike to know the person more rather than having, you know, hundreds and thousands of people in our team and you know AI controlling all of them so we like to work with you know a certain set of people and we like to hand pick them right even if you look at organization study recruitment to a certain stage I believe AI is useful like internal screening and things like that but then after a certain point you need to actually get to know the person because you know something such as can you know figure out and distinguish the qualitative and the quantitative factors quantitatively if the person might be very good but then qualitatively he might not be the right thing for your organization right yeah that is something which I have noticed that's why we have not used it any of the support and other other aspects of it customer support right now we offer these custom maintenance\neliminate services, right? We have not developed our systems to an extent where AI could probably replace our customer support team.\nYou know, because let's say a customer, there's something called as a customer satisfaction rate, right? AI, if we used it right now, the satisfaction rate would go to the floor because, you know, a person was developed that software, he'll have a better idea of what are the bugs in that software that could possibly come.\nAnd he find a better way to fix it, probably using some assistance for me. then the idea is that the efficiency would be higher.\nProbably in the future, as an when we grow, if I, you know, started using AI to replace these guys, probably to an extent, not entirely, like what screening process again, as I said, that would be useful there.\nBut then, ultimately, they would be having to reconnect it to a human, right?\n\n@34:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMajorly it is due to the, because it's not needed due to scale right now, maybe at a time it's needed for scale, you would use it but again very sparingly based on the fact that humans can create much better relationship.\nIs that correct? Service based industry, we are providing services.\n\n@34:20 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nWhen people look out for services, they expect a certain amount of human involvement. They like AI, but then they don't like it so much they have to waste time with their AI chatbot to figure out what their actual problem is and then come to us with just this process.\nIt would be good for us but then there's a chance of losing that customer faster so that is how it works.\n\n@34:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd what do you feel about losing your proprietary data to these AI models where they can use your data for trading and that might just not be any more quite private?\nACTION ITEM: Continue development of blockers/tools to prevent sharing sensitive company/client data with AI models - WATCH\n\n@34:56 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nYes, that is again security aspect. to the company, as when a company grows, we do not like to give out all the information to an AI.\nSo every time we put out a prompt, there's these people who are coming right now, I hired two people, so they call themselves prompt engineers, still figuring out what to do with them, right?\nACTION ITEM: Determine specific applications/use cases for newly hired prompt engineers in company workflows - WATCH\nBecause I know they are good at sending out prompts, but I want to know where I can actually use them.\nSo we have, let's say if I'm working with Hilton or I took an example, I will say company etch, and I'm not going to release the name of the company or which industry they have found, right?\nIdeally, that would help them build the software better, but then some amount of data must be kept with us, like financial data, how many finances is Jackie AI, so that he can get away with you, right?\nACTION ITEM: Create formal framework for employee AI usage guidelines. Include judicious use, data protection, limitations - WATCH\nYou would like to have that information with us.\n\n@35:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe will not be surprised on how much employees can sometimes be naive in terms of copy posting and saying, hey, what is my, what is my\n\n@36:00 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nand we'll return out of this that kind of question and that kind of data has gone right yeah how limitations are being put into place we are not trying to you know like give out all the information to a because we're hungry okay guardrails to your employees are you giving training are you telling them this cannot then this can be done is there a set of rules that you're putting to them yes that is being done absolutely we would not like to have all the information you know center to pay some things must remain as you could in the organization otherwise you know everyone will start following the same thing because AI core knowledge who got you know who of course you know he'll be able to tell everybody everything and then you know you are USP what they call it will not remain a USP anymore because anyone can be copy based on model and find out things right so guardrailing is being done I believe more organizations should do it otherwise you know the uniqueness of their organization\n\n@37:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nis being done by tools or just by telling them to, hey, you have to do these things or is there other tools or any blockers.\n\n@37:12 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nYeah, so there are blockers, we are right, developing them, we're still working on them, it's not perfect. You know, because as a smaller company, we're trying to grow as well, right.\nSo, you know, some amount of money is going towards, you know, setting up these things such as that. You cannot spend out company financial data that's changed with the auditor.\nThe auditor has been given, like, you know, cut off some things from his, you know, systems, right. We block certain things, but then it's not been as effective.\nThey still end up using, like, let's say, financial report, generate, cut off. But if we tell them, yeah, we're using it, they need to be a proper letter that is written by the CA of the auditor, This is the financial report.\n\n@38:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nfor you. Now, customers share a lot of data when you are developing software for them, right? Correct. And some of those are also proprietary pieces of information.\nYeah.\n\n@38:12 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nhave to leave it out.\n\n@38:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow do you manage that?\n\n@38:14 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nWe signed term sheets with the company stating that, you know, certain amount of the data might go to artificial intelligence, right?\nThey have the right to tell us, you know, what can be used, what can be used.\n\n@38:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut data is separate.\n\n@38:30 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSome things like certain companies have restrictions like, you know, we don't want this information to go out public. Please keep it for potential.\nHere, people are not yet talking about it like openly. That is go up. Here, I get through my daily.\nIf you have other data, it will go out either way, right? Somehow, it will reach the public. They are not, you know, expecting as of now until we tell them.\nSo, it is our duty to, you know, inform the customers with the customer's duty to also.\n\n@39:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nquest for certain things, so let us say the customer requested how do we have a system that stops this from happening or do we trust enough people and say hey we told our people this is not to be shared so there's not supposed to share it.\n\n@39:12 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nSo basically it sounds certain data does not want to reach the customers, right? We have the stages of management learning.\nIt does not go out to a lower level of management where you know they can distribute that information among all the developers but we have it you know on our servers and they can request certain data as and when needed, right?\nthat data is not publicly available, it's only available to a few set of people who are informed that this must not pass through AI, right?\n\n@39:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's basically human directed, it's not a tool direction.\n\n@39:48 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nYeah, we are working on that tool but then it's not completely ready.\n\n@39:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay and in terms of encouraging people so that it will go to it, right? Developer might just be too dependent on AI and create like really bad code because he's he's not using his expediency He's just using AI and he's just not showing out great things So what is your level of pushing people?\nHey, you should use AI or hey use AI judicious me or hey You should not use air for these things and you should use them for these things What exactly is your direction to write like that?\n\n@40:26 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nOr it is mostly like use air judicious don't not depend on AI because our job here use get software out there because some things are like Ochaljaga, but then Oskib each has your back and have a walk or just been hovering the app cable you know because it's error later on and you're not able to fix it then you will be caught right so you use your idea but then you can use AI if it's like you know to the extreme where you're wasting a lot of time\nwhen you approach AI. Creative things like predictive, know, phrases and all that are always there, but then, you know, we try to limit it as much as possible, because there's no specific framework that you have created or given them yet.\n\n@41:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's just mostly again human driven, right? You're telling them to do this, they are supposed to follow that, right?\nThanks. Thanks enough. I have got all the information I needed for this thing. Thank you so much for your time.\nAbsolutely.\n\n@41:32 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nworries. You have a good one. Have a pleasure.\n\n@41:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you.\n\n@41:35 - Arnav Mukherjee (nexacoresolutions.com)\nAll right.\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.

        "content": "Recording now, so you understand what we are trying to do, right?\n0:00:00 – 0:00:08\n\nWe are trying to understand where Gen. AI has reached,\n0:00:08 – 0:00:13\n\nwhere people have practically and beneficially used it and where we think it will come in handy,\n0:00:13 – 0:00:19\n\nbut okay, it needs more efforts or more resources or whatever, it needs further, right?\n0:00:19 – 0:00:24\n\nSo we want to understand where it is right now in terms of a company of your size.\n0:00:24 – 0:00:28\n\nSo let's first figure that out.\n0:00:28 – 0:00:30\n\nSo industry and sector wise, what industry do you think this is and if there is any specific sector?\n0:00:30 – 0:00:40\n\nSir, we are mainly talking about IT, what do we require?\n0:00:40 – 0:00:46\n\nNo, the overall company's industry or sector.\n0:00:46 – 0:00:52\n\nSir, services.\n0:00:52 – 0:00:53\n\nTech end services, software services, right?\n0:00:53 – 0:00:55\n\nYes, sir.\n0:00:55 – 0:00:57\n\nSoftware services, do you have any special focus?\n0:00:57 – 0:01:01\n\nNo, nothing like that.\n0:01:01 – 0:01:03\n\nThere are some requirements from the client side.\n0:01:03 – 0:01:06\n\nThere is sector, tech mode, tech management, there is nothing special.\n0:01:06 – 0:01:10\n\nOkay.\n0:01:10 – 0:01:12\n\nSo basically, just a customized solution, right?\n0:01:12 – 0:01:15\n\nYes, sir.\n0:01:15 – 0:01:16\n\nOkay.\n0:01:16 – 0:01:17\n\nNow in terms of company size, how many people and what is the revenue, what is the turnover that we have had?\n0:01:17 – 0:01:23\n\nSir, around 20 to 25 team size.\n0:01:23 – 0:01:27\n\n20 to 25 team size?\n0:01:27 – 0:01:29\n\nYes, sir.\n0:01:29 – 0:01:30\n\nAnd last year, the revenue, turnover around 3 CR.\n0:01:30 – 0:01:35\n\n3 CR?\n0:01:35 – 0:01:37\n\n15 CR.\n0:01:37 – 0:01:38\n\nSorry?\n0:01:38 – 0:01:40\n\n15, sir.\n0:01:40 – 0:01:41\n\nOkay, 15, 15 CR.\n0:01:41 – 0:01:43\n\nYes, sir.\n0:01:43 – 0:01:44\n\nWhich is very good, nice.\n0:01:44 – 0:01:47\n\nThank you, sir.\n0:01:47 – 0:01:48\n\nGreat.\n0:01:48 – 0:01:49\n\nNow, what is the AI adoption level?\n0:01:49 – 0:01:52\n\nNow, many times what we do is, we think about AI adoption as, I have made a customer an AI tool.\n0:01:52 – 0:02:00\n\nRight?\n0:02:00 – 0:02:01\n\nBut it's not only that.\n0:02:01 – 0:02:02\n\nIt goes beyond that.\n0:02:02 – 0:02:03\n\nIt's like we use Copilot.\n0:02:03 – 0:02:06\n\nRight?\n0:02:06 – 0:02:07\n\nThat is an AI adoption.\n0:02:07 – 0:02:09\n\nWe create content for marketing.\n0:02:09 – 0:02:13\n\nThat is AI adoption, right?\n0:02:13 – 0:02:15\n\nWe create images to put in Facebook.\n0:02:15 – 0:02:18\n\nThat is AI adoption.\n0:02:18 – 0:02:21\n\nNow, AI adoption will be internal and external.\n0:02:21 – 0:02:25\n\nInternal means what we use inside the company's work.\n0:02:25 – 0:02:28\n\nExternal means what we use outside the company's work.\n0:02:28 – 0:02:32\n\nRight?\n0:02:32 – 0:02:33\n\nSo, now considering these things, what do you think is the AI adoption level in your head right now?\n0:02:33 – 0:02:40\n\nThat we are doing okay, we are doing high adoption, mid adoption, low adoption, right?\n0:02:40 – 0:02:47\n\nWe have kept this low adoption in the category that we use AI adoption only for content.\n0:02:47 – 0:02:58\n\nOtherwise, if we have to search for something, we use AI adoption.\n0:02:58 – 0:03:05\n\nOtherwise, we are still on a more comfortable step.\n0:03:05 – 0:03:09\n\nOkay.\n0:03:09 – 0:03:10\n\nUnderstood.\n0:03:10 – 0:03:18\n\nIt's mainly content only.\n0:03:18 – 0:03:20\n\nMainly content?\n0:03:20 – 0:03:22\n\nYes.\n0:03:22 – 0:03:23\n\nOkay.\n0:03:23 – 0:03:24\n\nNow, any specific AI project that we have tried to implement internally and externally, is it successful or not?\n0:03:24 – 0:03:34\n\nI don't know.\n0:03:34 – 0:03:36\n\nSir, recently we have used a finite set of data to search for information.\n0:03:36 – 0:03:45\n\nRack tool?\n0:03:45 – 0:03:46\n\nYes, sir.\n0:03:46 – 0:03:47\n\nFrom N20 pages, voice PDF, YouTube, Paranayaki, we searched for PDF.\n0:03:47 – 0:03:52\n\nIf it is an outside PDF, it will say the number of callbacks.\n0:03:52 – 0:03:55\n\nBasically, you have set up Rack tool?\n0:03:55 – 0:03:58\n\nYes, sir.\n0:03:58 – 0:03:59\n\nOkay.\n0:03:59 – 0:04:00\n\nSimilarly, I have also set up a similar application of TVQ.\n0:04:00 – 0:04:07\n\nIf I have some 1000 articles, I go inside the articles and search for the intent of the article.\n0:04:07 – 0:04:18\n\nOkay.\n0:04:18 – 0:04:19\n\nThere was an application in Maltec, where the companies in my company, their social media presence and engagement of users on their social media posts, what was the level of that?\n0:04:19 – 0:04:41\n\nWe used NLM and TTP. We also used random forest.\n0:04:41 – 0:04:53\n\nOkay.\n0:04:53 – 0:04:58\n\nThat's good.\n0:04:58 – 0:05:01\n\nAnd how successful was this? Let us say, 80% accuracy, 90% accuracy, 100% accuracy and how beneficial were we able to achieve the end business goal?\n0:05:01 – 0:05:12\n\nYes, sir. 85% accuracy.\n0:05:12 – 0:05:17\n\nOkay. Great. Let's look at the strategic goal.\n0:05:17 – 0:05:33\n\nBasically, the company's goal. What you have in mind and yours is not fully profit-focused. You also have a goal of developing people from what I know, bringing them up, bringing them out so that people from smaller towns and villages can come up and do things, which is a very novel idea that you have.\n0:05:33 – 0:05:53\n\nSo, based on those and other business strategic goals, what do you think? Do you think they can benefit from AI? You can benefit from AI on those goals or what is your take for those?\n0:05:53 – 0:06:11\n\nIt's definitely happening and it will happen. We will also launch AI. I'm talking about the business as well as the office.\n0:06:11 – 0:06:26\n\nSo, 100% with all. I have told you before that the AI developer in the village is doing a lot of things. I won't tell the AI developers who are working in a lot of companies about those terms.\n0:06:26 – 0:06:50\n\nSo, I have told you before that I have a project because I have some funds and I have used those funds in their training.\n0:06:50 – 0:07:08\n\nSo, they have done a lot of work and they have saved a lot of money. Our focus was AI plus and some other companies are working on it. So, I have won a lot of money.\n0:07:08 – 0:07:30\n\nSo, have you spent the funds in training courses or in training?\n0:07:30 – 0:07:36\n\nI haven't done any work with them. For example, I can work for 2000 hours in a quarter. Out of those 1000 hours, I have worked for 50% hours.\n0:07:36 – 0:07:52\n\nI haven't worked with them in self-study and in time-to-time evaluation. I haven't worked with them in time-to-time evaluation.\n0:07:52 – 0:08:08\n\nAre these paid courses or free courses?\n0:08:08 – 0:08:13\n\nBoth are paid courses and free courses. Some are free courses and some are sessions with industry experts.\n0:08:13 – 0:08:33\n\nGood. How is it paying off? Do you think this is getting them to a level where now you can pick up projects and work with them or do you think it still needs more time?\n0:08:33 – 0:08:43\n\nSir, it needs a little more time. I am able to do the basic requirements now but if I want to make some advanced models at an advanced level, I will need a little more time to do that.\n0:08:43 – 0:09:03\n\nIf you need guidance in all that, let me know. I can jump in and I can help your team out.\n0:09:03 – 0:09:08\n\nOkay. That's great. You gave me one example of the social media engagement using GPT or Admo Forest.\n0:09:08 – 0:09:21\n\nAre there other such AI achievements that you have been able to do in the recent past and what they were and how they were if you are able to share them?\n0:09:21 – 0:09:33\n\nAnd again, successful or unsuccessful, both ways is fine.\n0:09:33 – 0:09:38\n\nSir, can you ask me again?\n0:09:38 – 0:09:42\n\nLike you shared with me that we worked on social media using GPT and Admo Forest.\n0:09:42 – 0:09:49\n\nExactly. Are there other projects that we have worked on in this domain, whether they are successful or unsuccessful?\n0:09:49 – 0:09:57\n\nNo, sir. We have started this from last year. We have done three projects. One of them is Social Alert and the other one is for Chat.\n0:09:57 – 0:10:16\n\nOne is basic chat.\n0:10:16 – 0:10:18\n\nCopilot?\n0:10:18 – 0:10:19\n\nChatbot.\n0:10:19 – 0:10:20\n\nCopilot Assistant. Chatbot Assistant kind.\n0:10:20 – 0:10:23\n\nThat is basically your rag and intent-based search, right?\n0:10:23 – 0:10:33\n\nYes, sir.\n0:10:33 – 0:10:34\n\nAnd you have ragged RDBMS and the other one is your vector-based rag, right?\n0:10:34 – 0:10:43\n\nYes, sir.\n0:10:43 – 0:10:44\n\nOkay. So, the PDA one will be vector-based and the other one will be RDBMS-based, right?\n0:10:44 – 0:10:50\n\nYes, sir.\n0:10:50 – 0:10:52\n\nGreat. This is awesome.\n0:10:52 – 0:11:07\n\nAnd what was the success ratio in these? I mean, what were the challenges that you faced? One challenge would be definitely bringing the team up.\n0:11:07 – 0:11:16\n\nYes, sir.\n0:11:16 – 0:11:17\n\nWhat else?\n0:11:17 – 0:11:19\n\nThe next challenge would be testing. You know that you will get the output in the application, right?\n0:11:19 – 0:11:28\n\nNow, sometimes the test values, sometimes the output is right or wrong, it becomes difficult to judge.\n0:11:28 – 0:11:40\n\nSo, the main challenge and the time taking would be testing.\n0:11:40 – 0:11:44\n\nSo, you have not used the automatic testing in this till now?\n0:11:44 – 0:11:47\n\nNo, sir.\n0:11:47 – 0:11:49\n\nYou should try things like prompt-foo and others. They are good ways of doing those.\n0:11:49 – 0:11:55\n\nThere are some very good ways of automatic testing. Otherwise, manually testing will become a killer.\n0:11:55 – 0:12:00\n\nIt will just suck away your time and every time, if a person is in a good mood, he will say good things and if he is in a bad mood, he will say bad things. It is so subjective.\n0:12:00 – 0:12:08\n\nYes, sir.\n0:12:08 – 0:12:10\n\nWe have faced those as well. Nice. That is a good one. What else? What other challenges have you faced?\n0:12:10 – 0:12:15\n\nThese are the two challenges. One is that our support is very subjective. You will get it for something and you will not get it for something else.\n0:12:15 – 0:12:32\n\nSo, these are the two challenges.\n0:12:32 – 0:12:35\n\nThe second challenge is that our team members have to work with the talent that they have. There are thousands of things that are being worked on and the thing that I have is also being worked on.\n0:12:35 – 0:12:47\n\nOne project that we are working on, which has just started, is Mehlal. We will tell you the context of the project. We are working on the thought and detection of the user.\n0:12:47 – 0:13:05\n\nWe are going to use AI, like how to use the phone of the user. How much pressure does the user put on the phone when they are using the application.\n0:13:05 – 0:13:19\n\nBasically, you are trying to capture signals other than the regular signals.\n0:13:19 – 0:13:38\n\nYes, sir. When the user is using the phone, how much pressure does he put on the phone, how does he do it or how does he do it. There is no way of doing it.\n0:13:38 – 0:13:50\n\nYou have to detect the pattern of the phone and identify whether it is the same person or the same person.\n0:13:50 – 0:13:59\n\nYou have to get the accuracy percentage of the person.\n0:13:59 – 0:14:01\n\nYes, sir.\n0:14:01 – 0:14:03\n\nAt that time, we will give this data to the person because he has a talent. If he thinks that someone is using it, he will take it to the MFA.\n0:14:03 – 0:14:22\n\nWe call it FRM.\n0:14:22 – 0:14:28\n\nNice. How far have we gone?\n0:14:28 – 0:14:31\n\nWe have started the detection of the fingerprint of the device.\n0:14:31 – 0:14:38\n\nIt is in the working condition. It will complete in a similar manner.\n0:14:38 – 0:14:46\n\nWhat are the challenges that you are facing in this one? One is the training of the team, the other is testing. I can guide you on that. What else?\n0:14:46 – 0:14:55\n\nSir, there is an interview where we have to post the IP address of the application, where to keep it and how to stick it.\n0:14:55 – 0:15:05\n\nWe have to figure out that.\n0:15:05 – 0:15:07\n\nOkay.\n0:15:07 – 0:15:09\n\nWhat will be the pipeline? What pipeline will be there?\n0:15:09 – 0:15:15\n\nI think that is the interrelated thing. That is another challenge.\n0:15:15 – 0:15:19\n\nWho is taking the architectural decisions?\n0:15:19 – 0:15:26\n\nA lot of this depends on architectural decision. Whether you are placing a queue in between or not placing a queue in between.\n0:15:26 – 0:15:32\n\nWhether you have a push queue, pull queue, what kind of queue you have. Whether you are using a stream or a pipe. What are you exactly using depending on those things.\n0:15:32 – 0:15:43\n\nWho is taking the decision? I have done some research.\n0:15:43 – 0:15:49\n\nGood. After you, is there any other research that you can do? Are you documenting your research?\n0:15:49 – 0:15:55\n\nI am not documenting my research. I have done some research in Mumbai. I am going to do some research there. I am going to do some research there. I am going to do some research there.\n0:15:55 – 0:16:14\n\nThere is a plan to build a small AI for 3-4 people. I will ask them to do some research on that. I will take the decision on that.\n0:16:14 – 0:16:32\n\nGood. Good. Okay. Now, when you are doing all this and all the problems that we have shared are all generally people related or infrastructure related.\n0:16:32 – 0:16:54\n\nProblem can also be process related. For example, you are having a process right now. For example, testing is a process related problem. Is there any other problem related to such a process?\n0:16:54 – 0:17:06\n\nSo far, we have not used any standard process to develop any application. Okay. Have you thought of any changes in this?\n0:17:06 – 0:17:24\n\nNo sir. So far, we have not done anything like that. We are still in the early stages of AI development and development. But yes, as soon as we have to do something, we will tell you.\n0:17:24 – 0:17:38\n\nThat's nice. That's very nice. And what about culture? What is it that you push to the team as a culture?\n0:17:38 – 0:17:48\n\nThat is, everyone has to use AI and their work has to be pushed by AI or use it as a tool. I don't really care. I care about the output.\n0:17:48 – 0:17:58\n\nOr everybody has to mandatory do it because you are already giving 50% of the time for them to train. And you have to give me benefits of this by using it further in your usage as well as customer usage.\n0:17:58 – 0:18:11\n\nWhat kind of culture do you want to generate? Sir, it is still very open. My plan was to train them. It is better if I push them. I want them to come to me and say, let's do this.\n0:18:11 – 0:18:29\n\nI have kept it very open. I don't care if it is mandatory or not. And I am waiting for them to give me some benefits. What is your take on it that in the next few days, it should half their efforts or in the next few days, it should make the products better?\n0:18:29 – 0:18:58\n\nOr in the next few days, it should reduce my manpower requirement or increase the number of projects that I can handle?\n0:18:58 – 0:19:08\n\nSir, as far as development is concerned, if I want to develop a product, I have to develop it. AI is not that evolved yet. There is still a traditional way to develop it.\n0:19:08 – 0:19:34\n\nSir, I think we will have to develop it in such a way that we will have to develop it in different ways.\n0:19:34 – 0:19:48\n\nBut in between, the point is that, let's say it doesn't complete it, but 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, to some extent it reduces the work that we have been doing for a long time. What do you think, can the team get any benefit from it or not?\n0:19:48 – 0:20:08\n\nSir, we can do things like that. But as I told you in the start, there is still a lot of dependency on the platform, but they have also aligned themselves with AI and they have optimized a lot of the search.\n0:20:08 – 0:20:26\n\nSo we don't use AI directly, we are using AI through the platform. The way they have adopted AI, the search has been better. If we search wrongly, if our intent is right, then we will get the right result.\n0:20:26 – 0:20:41\n\nBut not directly, everything is happening directly. Do you mean to say that we are using a tool like GitHub Copilot or a tool like Cursor AI? We are not using Cursor AI, we are not using GitHub Copilot.\n0:20:41 – 0:20:59\n\nI will have a talk with your team sometime. We will have a session and I will spend some time with them.\n0:20:59 – 0:21:19\n\nHave you ever thought of gathering them? I will gather them once a year. Sir, there is a plan to go to Dubai this time. Where will you go?\n0:21:19 – 0:21:30\n\nWe will go to Dubai. We will go to India. We will go to Dubai. We will go there. We will go to Madhya Pradesh. We will go to Dubai.\n0:21:30 – 0:21:54\n\nVery good. We will make a remote call and spend some time with them. When will you go there?\n0:21:54 – 0:22:02\n\nSir, we can call them now. They are in Delhi in the morning. I will tell you. Can someone schedule a day or do it for free? I will spend one hour with them and that should be enough.\n0:22:02 – 0:22:24\n\nIt will be fun. Our work is not only technical and development. We are running a company and you will have to talk about taxes, finance, marketing, customer relationship management etc.\n0:22:24 – 0:22:44\n\nSo, in those also, where is this being used and what are the benefits?\n0:22:44 – 0:22:54\n\nSir, there is no usage in operations at all. No usage in operations at all?\n0:22:54 – 0:23:00\n\nSir, the accounts are outsourced and HR is outsourced. But the work that I have is mainly time and sales. The main thing that I have is interaction with the team, project management and client coordination.\n0:23:00 – 0:23:18\n\nThere is no use in that. If you tell me one or two times, I will try my best.\n0:23:18 – 0:23:30\n\nGreat. So, if I talk about future plans, what do you think are the areas where if you close your eyes and you think that AI will work as we expect it to, then where can we use it in your operations right now?\n0:23:30 – 0:23:52\n\nAgain, think about technology, people, data, process, culture and operations. Start with technology.\n0:23:52 – 0:23:58\n\nSir, I have a small idea which I want to share with you. Some people have to pay their bills to the accounts, which is also expensive.\n0:23:58 – 0:24:08\n\nBut if you make a drop area of the box, you can put the bill there and automatically categorize it and the bill will go there and make an entry in the account.\n0:24:08 – 0:24:19\n\nSo, the manual work is very simple application.\n0:24:19 – 0:24:22\n\nI had thought for a long time that I will not get the time to make it. So, if you want to make this, I can also give my inputs.\n0:24:22 – 0:24:29\n\nThere is no issue. It will be made very well.\n0:24:29 – 0:24:31\n\nSir, do you have an idea of the two guys working in India?\n0:24:31 – 0:24:37\n\nThe idea was that whoever takes the bill anywhere, take a photo of it.\n0:24:37 – 0:24:42\n\nHe will take the rest of the photo and take the whole open CV. He will categorize it from there and send it wherever he wants.\n0:24:42 – 0:24:49\n\nAt the end of the day, if you want my accounts, he will take it out and give it to you.\n0:24:49 – 0:24:53\n\nWhatever has to be submitted in the office, will be submitted in the office. You have to go to your CA and the CA will go and so on.\n0:24:53 – 0:24:59\n\nThat will be very handy too. And there is nothing like this in the market now.\n0:24:59 – 0:25:03\n\nOf course, sir. We can make it very easily. I don't know why it should have been like this.\n0:25:03 – 0:25:08\n\nI didn't get the time either. This came actually. So, there was one company that started something like this, but they only did it for corporates.\n0:25:08 – 0:25:16\n\nWe implemented it in the office. When you were there, we tried to implement it for the credit card.\n0:25:16 – 0:25:23\n\nBut after that, that company neither went ahead nor did we take any further steps. So, that died down.\n0:25:23 – 0:25:30\n\nAfter that, sometimes I thought that if we take out the money, we don't get much time.\n0:25:30 – 0:25:34\n\nBut this is a good idea, which is like monetizable.\n0:25:34 – 0:25:38\n\nSo, sir, this is the rest of the small things like I am not an account holder, you are not an account holder. Sometimes there are some things that are related to accounts or legal advisers.\n0:25:38 – 0:25:50\n\nSo, if I get a little needle, I will ask for it in a generative way. It will tell me if it is right or wrong or if it is right or wrong.\n0:25:50 – 0:26:05\n\nWhat problem can I face if I do this? So, that is a big problem. So, I think accounting related problems are there.\n0:26:05 – 0:26:22\n\nAnd what is written in the people related area?\n0:26:22 – 0:26:25\n\nIn the people related area, if I can draw a summary of the team's productivity, or I can distribute the work.\n0:26:25 – 0:26:39\n\nIf I see the current work, I will know what quality people are going to get. So, that is a control record.\n0:26:39 – 0:26:50\n\nOkay, makes sense. Anything else?\n0:26:50 – 0:26:56\n\nI have got two things. One is productivity summary and the other is work distribution capability.\n0:26:56 – 0:27:05\n\nYes, sir.\n0:27:05 – 0:27:07\n\nIn terms of data, now data is a bit sensitive, right?\n0:27:07 – 0:27:24\n\nYes, sir.\n0:27:24 – 0:27:25\n\nData is sensitive because you can't use proprietary data of your own or customer's because that will go out to the LLM and LLM can use it based on their learning and all, right?\n0:27:25 – 0:27:36\n\nAnd so on. So, in terms of data, what do you think might be a future plan where you can implement or enhance the capabilities of your organization for your customers or yourself?\n0:27:36 – 0:27:48\n\nSir, data is always a concern. A few days ago, I had a particular boss, his concern was this. His concern was that the data that I will give, whether it is PDF or database access, where will the data be stored?\n0:27:48 – 0:28:03\n\nSo, it will be stored with you or you will give the data to him, he will hold the data. So, this is a data related problem. It happened to me when we were able to bring in-premises AI, i.e. learning models or we were able to do something with it, it was stored in other devices only. So, it is possible.\n0:28:03 – 0:28:28\n\nIn case you still have that customer, I can teach you how you can get that done, that is also possible.\n0:28:28 – 0:28:33\n\nYes, sir. Here, you are a little…and there is also an organization like this or there is a defense where AI is needed but since they don't want to do it, their data will go out at different times.\n0:28:33 – 0:28:45\n\nSo, for that also, we were handling the Ministry of Defense for UK, right? They had the same concerns and other defense organizations in US and UK. So, for that also, we have solutions. We can sit down and talk about it whenever you want.\n0:28:45 – 0:29:05\n\nSure, sir. Good, good. And then the next part comes, the processes. Do you think that by benefiting from it, our processes can be better? I mean, I can save my time in terms of the process or I can improve the process or I can do it quickly by changing some processes and all. I mean, both the way.\n0:29:05 – 0:29:28\n\nSir, we can do it. I mean, I think that if I talk about the process of many things, for example, if I talk about the management process, AI will evolve a lot, but it doesn't evolve with it.\n0:29:28 – 0:29:48\n\nSo, if I can introduce AI a little bit, then our process will also get simplified.\n0:29:48 – 0:30:00\n\nOkay. And then we talk about culture. Do you think that, I mean, we need to further evolve this? We need to further, I mean, make it as a part of our culture or do you think that now we should get benefits out of it? What's your plan on that?\n0:30:00 – 0:30:19\n\nSir, I haven't done it yet. I mean, I haven't said it yet and neither am I doing it, but I was interested in it at the time. By the way, if I talk to you now, you will tell me and I will use it and I will say, yes, this can't be done. Then I will tell you to use the RK tool.\n0:30:19 – 0:30:37\n\nLike when the chat GPT came, the rest of the people didn't know that they can go to the GPT and what they can search. So, I told them that I liked it. Now, the rest of the things like Google and other things go to it.\n0:30:37 – 0:30:51\n\nSo, if there is something else related to it, I will recommend them. Now, I will tell them about taxiing tech and then they can use it and make it as a part of their life.\n0:30:51 – 0:31:10\n\nOkay, makes sense. And the last one is operations within the company. You had already told me in terms of bills, accounts, etc. But they were technology oriented. But operations in other sense like marketing, support, because as the company will grow, support will also grow.\n0:31:10 – 0:31:31\n\nAll those things, are they something that you think about or what?\n0:31:31 – 0:31:37\n\nNo, definitely not. There is already a lot of advancement in support. I feel that 70-80% of AI can give a phone.\n0:31:37 – 0:31:50\n\nOkay. And all these things, are you planning in the next one year horizon, five year horizon, three year horizon, what is the plan?\n0:31:50 – 0:32:13\n\nAlso one to three years.\n0:32:13 – 0:32:15\n\nOne to three years?\n0:32:15 – 0:32:16\n\nYes, sir.\n0:32:16 – 0:32:17\n\nOkay. Now, we will move on to a slight more of your opinionated approach. Okay, less of actually. So, first is with all this that you have seen so far, right? You have been with your employees doing this, customers doing this and you have read about it, heard about it.\n0:32:17 – 0:32:43\n\nSo far, what is the hardest hurdle or still is in implementing GNI? What do you think is the hardest hurdle?\n0:32:43 – 0:32:52\n\nSir, maybe it is the confidence.\n0:32:52 – 0:32:55\n\nReliability?\n0:32:55 – 0:32:56\n\nYes, sir. It still seems a bit romantic that if we do this, maybe it will be able to do efficiency or not do anything. That is one thing.\n0:32:56 – 0:33:09\n\nRight. That I totally agree with. And again, looking at this, what do you think has been the most successful GNI for you so far? I mean, what is your job or what is your customer's job in which you feel that he has done a great job? I mean, it was really good.\n0:33:09 – 0:33:31\n\nSir, content.\n0:33:31 – 0:33:33\n\nContent generation.\n0:33:33 – 0:33:34\n\nYes, sir.\n0:33:34 – 0:33:35\n\nAnd I mean, if you put it in terms of business or dollar value or ruby value, what do you feel? How much did you benefit?\n0:33:35 – 0:33:45\n\nSir, what is the scale of this? I mean, in your terms that, pick it on something that is measurable.\n0:33:45 – 0:33:57\n\nIn a measurable term, whether it be a dollar value or time value or whatever, what do you think? That content that he took or that he gave to the container, is it saving me 10 hours, thousand dollars, right? Or let's say 5 people, what?\n0:33:57 – 0:34:16\n\nSir, if I talk about hourly, I mean, if there is a content right or a content attitude, it will be around 50,000 per month.\n0:34:16 – 0:34:31\n\nSo, around 50% of your expense gets saved as what you pay?\n0:34:31 – 0:34:35\n\n50% right.\n0:34:35 – 0:34:36\n\nAround 50%?\n0:34:36 – 0:34:38\n\nYes, sir.\n0:34:38 – 0:34:39\n\nOkay. Okay. And while doing all this, right, for example, there is an if and a no that, oh man, this thing, right, I got to learn something, I got to understand something, oh what is this?\n0:34:39 – 0:34:56\n\nSo, with all this GNI happening, what is the thing that you realized that, oh man, this is something different, man, you have learned something, man, I mean, you said that there is a unique moment, oh man, there is something different, something further.\n0:34:56 – 0:35:14\n\nSir, when I read the text and read the video and when I looked at the images, I realized that this is right, okay, that is the moment.\n0:35:14 – 0:35:29\n\nAnd, I mean, how do you translate that to business or work?\n0:35:29 – 0:35:33\n\nIt could be as simple as if he can do this, then he can also do this. It could be even a relation like that.\n0:35:33 – 0:35:41\n\nThat's fine.\n0:35:41 – 0:35:43\n\nSir, I mean, there is a content creation that I made some videos with some ideas and made my own platform, which I was making, so that I can educate people by making a small platform.\n0:35:43 – 0:35:59\n\nLike nowadays fraud is happening, fraud is based on making 20-25 videos, it was very difficult to make it before, I had to make 3 movies, I had to make video recording, I had to make editing, I had to make voiceover, all that can't be easily done now.\n0:35:59 – 0:36:16\n\nGood, good.\n0:36:16 – 0:36:18\n\nThat makes sense. So, editing, video editing, we can do on your own, right?\n0:36:18 – 0:36:24\n\nYes, sir.\n0:36:24 – 0:36:26\n\nGood.\n0:36:26 – 0:36:28\n\nOkay, if you had a chance that you could go a year earlier, right, and the technology that you realized that it has come from a year, you can understand it then, then what difference would you make?\n0:36:28 – 0:36:50\n\nIf, what I am doing now, if a year, sir, I would have reduced the dependency a little, if I would have done that a year earlier.\n0:36:50 – 0:37:08\n\nDependency on what?\n0:37:08 – 0:37:10\n\nDependency on other tools.\n0:37:10 – 0:37:12\n\nOkay.\n0:37:12 – 0:37:13\n\nThose are already complete tools, if they had come to me earlier, then I would have reduced the dependency a year earlier, some percentage of those tools are dependent on those tools, I would have taken care of that.\n0:37:13 – 0:37:26\n\nGive me an example of those tools.\n0:37:26 – 0:37:28\n\nFor example, there are LLM tools, where there are large language models, and they respond well in all languages, but they are not able to do it in a lot of regional languages, so maybe if I had resources, then I would be able to do the same thing for other languages.\n0:37:28 – 0:37:47\n\nBut that has already happened for the Indian language, LLM has already been made for the Indian language, they have already done it, so if you want to use it, you can go use it.\n0:37:47 – 0:37:54\n\nSir, right now, it is an investment of one or two years, but if I talk about myself, then maybe I would have wanted to do this.\n0:37:54 – 0:38:03\n\nOkay, then you would have wanted to do this, which is good, which is nice, what else?\n0:38:03 – 0:38:08\n\nIt is very nice, I mean even now it gives, to make an estimate from the estimate, which gives a lot of opportunity, but will never be responsible, if I had a little more capabilities, I would have involved a lot of people, make an estimate and take an estimate from them.\n0:38:08 – 0:38:32\n\nSir, right now, the quality is already good, it has started, but this was done before, so…\n0:38:32 – 0:38:38\n\nVery good, in fact, have you tried v0?\n0:38:38 – 0:38:41\n\nNo, sir.\n0:38:41 – 0:38:43\n\nGo and Google up Vercel v0.\n0:38:43 – 0:38:46\n\nVercel v0?\n0:38:46 – 0:38:48\n\nYes.\n0:38:48 – 0:38:49\n\nAnd you should be able to share that with your team and have fun with them.\n0:38:49 – 0:38:55\n\nNext, second last question.\n0:38:55 – 0:39:06\n\nYes, sir.\n0:39:06 – 0:39:08\n\nWhat is your opinion on businessmen, not in the sense of technology geek, is GNI very helpful, marginally helpful or not helpful and what drives your opinion?\n0:39:08 – 0:39:24\n\nWhat drives your opinion, I mean what drives your opinion in concrete numbers?\n0:39:24 – 0:39:30\n\nSir, very helpful.\n0:39:30 – 0:39:32\n\nOk.\n0:39:32 – 0:39:33\n\nI mean, I am a beginner, I mean I am a beginner.\n0:39:33 – 0:39:43\n\nIn terms of concrete number assigning, it is very helpful because it saves me x amount as a beginner or because it saves me x time as a beginner, what?\n0:39:43 – 0:39:55\n\nSir, 20% time, if I am outsourcing something, if I am starting to announce it, like the marketing related thing, then around 20-25% of the efforts of that work will be lost because if I convert it into revenue, then that 20% will be complete for me.\n0:39:55 – 0:40:17\n\nOk.\n0:40:17 – 0:40:26\n\nAnd the last one, what is your recommendation for the rest of the companies to travel through the digital transformation using generative AI?\n0:40:26 – 0:40:41\n\nWhat do you think, what would you recommend to them?\n0:40:41 – 0:40:44\n\nSir, main thing is the capability of development, if I want to implement it, I should first develop the capability and if that is developed, then automatically the journey begins.\n0:40:44 – 0:41:01\n\nOk, so that's your main suggestion, first develop your capability, develop your team and then move forward, right?\n0:41:01 – 0:41:10\n\nYes sir.\n0:41:10 – 0:41:11\n\nAwesome, awesome.\n0:41:11 – 0:41:13\n\nI think I have all the questions. I am closing the recording.\n0:41:13 – 0:41:16\n\nI am closing the video now.\n0:41:16 – 0:41:18\n\n\n\nRahul Pandey\n\nSoftware Services - COTS\n\n20-25 Team Size\n15 Cr\n\nLow Adoption - content / Dev Research\nComfortable on StackOverflow\n\nRAG -> PDF search or DB2 Articles\nSocial Media Engagements - Competetiotrs GPT + Random Forest\n80 - 85% Accuracy\n\nBenefit on Goals\nBusiness Upskill \nFunds on Team Training - Focus on AI / CV\nNo work - 50% Train - Courses Free + Paid + Industry Experts\nBasic requirements able - advanced models not yet\n\n3 Proj\nSocial - Chatbot - RAG (Vector RDBMS)\nTeam Train - Testing (Manual/) - \n\nFinTech - Fraud detection based on Usage - FRM\nFingerprint started - year end\n\nTeam Train - testing - Infra (hosting) - \nSensors (IOT) & AI\n\nProcess - Early Stage\n\nCulture - 50% time in training - Employee bring it further on their own - align\n\nFull Dev - not there -> AI based searches - Not using Cursor Ai or Github Co Pilot\nOps - Accounts/HR Out Sources - Project Management\n\nUse\nBills / Accounts -> Bills - Legal/Accounts Questions/Answer\nPeople - Productivity Summary / Work Distribution (Capabilities)\nData concern - location/security, ISRO / Defense\nProcess - JIRA etc not evolved with AI\nCulture - Encourage\nSupport - Marketing - CRM\n1 - 3 years\n\nReliability - Can it do\nContent - 50%\nGen AI -> Image to Vide - Educate (Editing / Processing)\n\nDifferently - Dependency on other tools - LLM/ regional Language, Figma to UI - DevOps\n\nVery Helpful - Beginner - 20-25% time save marketing\n\nRecommendation - Capability Dev - \n\n\n\n—--------------\n\nObkext / Things -> State\n\nEvent -> Time thing did something\nLog\nTrace\n\n\n",

        "content": "Transcript\nVinit | Vicky Research Interview - July 04\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 43 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI didn't know you were patronizing with the professor. I'm working on some other things as well along with this this was based on dual I mean like research and academic and research.\nOkay, very good. Probably moving on to PhD in the middle name. Okay, okay, I was also interested to go to PhD we had a five-track PhD in I am K Kori Kote.\n\n@1:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nwith a couple of us who were interested, but then I thought something started, I would like I would like to give you a chance.\n\n@1:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nit's a good one, but it's a big investment, it's not easy. I know it's three years and then it will be very intensive and very, you know, and definitely nice also.\nSo I have to go to the campus just frequently. I have to work, it's hard to work.\n\n@1:27 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo it's a big good life, decision change and then this family here also, I couldn't come back to that.\n\n@1:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, but in Mumbai there is an M which also provides the PHG for executive MBA. So I was interested in that also, for him and him I am.\nBut in the early time, getting the PHG is the name of PHG is easy, it's not difficult today. But you would not like to call yourself a doctor after getting the PHG, it's very hard.\n\n@2:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI am bit inclined towards academic actually but we are about the time name and time.\n\n@2:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's two nine time company, Japanese company, they were just relaxing and doing some stuff on my own row. I had some time wanted to play around with the possibility that see how it goes back.\nSo a part of this, even the research that we trying to do, we are trying to get two questions and we are trying to figure out the, a lot of question here.\nAsk you, let me look, yeah, use kara pare in terms of generative AI. I mean, they have done good things, bad things, but end of the day, use kara pare, right?\nAlthough, we have to make sure that's one question, that's pretty good. The second question that's important is, let us hope that this goes through and everything goes anti-dory and everything is nice based on what we understand so far.\nIn the longer when things get stabilized, what are the aspirations we have from this kind of technology? Right. Right.\nthese are two major questions because these are the two things that we want to figure out from different companies, around 200 companies that we interview.\nAnd we will drive this through different questions that I've already posted to you, I'll be following mostly those. Right.\nRight. So the hell up before we start industrial sector, we have defined the volume, we find which industry we are in.\nSo up now industry is home improvement.\n\n@3:35 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nHome improvement? devial design, we have a list of industrial drive down here.\n\n@3:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. Yeah. So, internet design link, though, in the shop, okay, okay, perfect, and what's the last company size in terms of people and revenue?\nMy company, no?\n\n@4:18 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, my company's love size right now is 18 strong, and the video we last last and.2 here, okay, and on the team size, 18.8,.8, 18 people right?\n\n@4:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight.\n\n@4:40 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\n8.2 here is the free the turnover.\n\n@4:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCorrect. That's great. And in terms of AI adoption, where do you feel you are in the cloud?\n\n@4:52 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSee the problem is now we never, never put any kind of KPI for us, right?\n\n@4:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd we like, we like it off.\n\n@5:12 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nbut the main KPI for me is that automation in AI should help me grow to let's say double my size in terms of revenue with only 20% increase to my employee base that that's a calculation we have done in terms of the next year's projections right so I don't know how to answer your question so again can you repeat your question maybe I will try to do something in my head and answer your question yeah so I mean as of now where do you feel you want to keep an eye out here right and where where do you see we are I mean I'm going to go start it up for you\n\n@6:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we were exploring whether can we be AIS at the fault store and as we be you know home interior at the fault store, but we don't want to be that way, but I have my I can you my nothing you might also disuse it.\nSo think up now our documents share Kiaath house. So we talked about our last 19th career.\n\n@6:42 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nOkay.\n\n@6:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I think that they go under Maraki under Maraki is the first option.\n\n@6:47 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nOkay.\n\n@6:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo have got some this.\n\n@6:50 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo we just don't want to be coming in.\n\n@6:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nstart up. I start up both things and I could able to cut which model like KFT, See you guys next time!\nIt's a very thing to I can do at this as possible.\n\n@7:06 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, we have a window of solutions.\n\n@7:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, then we think this key. Even though we have a new asset, but right now, we have AI power.\n\n@7:14 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, once that spreads, reaching the AI, we can fit AI in all the data analytics automation.\n\n@7:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAlmost all the levels of our business execution.\n\n@7:30 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWe are basically making a task platform, just kapura is the petition, kapura is in the data related to the tool or why it is tool, how is it a tool, it is just a layer, it is right, so if you ask me, if you ask me about the technical perspective, you guys really,\n\n@8:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSee if I go, if like say tomorrow, it becomes bad, because it is a very, very technology and these people kind of got it in terms of whatever, right, it is dream, illusion break.\n\n@8:14 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWe will go back to our thing, same one. Is this specific that we have tried so far?\n\n@8:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, so we have tried AI in, so right now we are sorting out our operation.\n\n@8:28 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAnd when we talk about operation, we are talking about CRM.\n\n@8:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, because we are talking customers, are talking to customers, sending emails, what's communication.\n\n@8:38 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThen the entire workflow of CRM, in which how do we do lead management, how do So is the something that we have already made with AI.\n\n@9:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow we can take the situation, if I have been running AI, we can take the cover of the website.\n\n@9:13 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWe have AI, blogs are put up on the website every week.\n\n@9:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe have started on page of portal.\n\n@9:20 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSome of them are AI-powered, AI-enhanced.\n\n@9:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight?\n\n@9:24 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThere is no way of doing this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't I don't know. know.\n\n@9:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ndon't I don't know.\n\n@9:39 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nknow.\n\n@9:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI know.\n\n@9:41 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nknow. I don't I don't don't know. I don't know.\n\n@9:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI don't don't created a talk bot. like a bit of a embedded glue on top of. opening eye.\n\n@10:01 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWhich has been given like set up under two hundred five hundred questions. The people will academic, they will push the other one.\nso people come to open.\n\n@10:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmake the center for what answer the question they answer the question.\n\n@10:16 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWhat if it keeps up calling the mind until later gives us an analysis of it. So basically India is it?\nIt's going to be is it? So, have more to cover as well, we a lot of questions here, but can you please like it is a human thing.\nis the specific of your house?\n\n@10:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhere is it located?\n\n@10:58 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nFantastic. If you are directly a Tuntun mender right now.\n\n@11:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, so Tullio, so Tullio has about 7p.\n\n@11:04 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nTullio is a community, community, community communication engine. Community communication, communication and SMS and even community. Right?\n\n@11:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we need all the other of use to get to Ilioka.\n\n@11:16 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nBut our transport is powered with AI, one which our own employees also talk to for internal components.\n\n@11:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOur customer is talking to us what's supposed to Our own data talk about it. Right?\n\n@11:34 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo this is our internal as well as external customer.\n\n@11:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes. Very nice.\n\n@11:41 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nLook, Tullio will be available as a chat, but also on our website. So what happens is that I think that's not short chat, it's not a short chat, it's not a short chat, chat, it's short chat.\nbit of a costly engine, so we want to get rid of it. We want to do this through the app and the chat button.\n\n@12:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, and next AI uses the okay, so we also create proposals opposite much key after we have looked at it.\n\n@12:10 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThis is because we really designed, we really designed the one This is the cooking taste and fish. This is taste of the fish.\n\n@12:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis of and fish. This taste taste and fish. is the taste of taste fish and fish.\n\n@12:31 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThis is taste and fish. This is the taste Patchifies.\n\n@12:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, and are there images automated? We will have to take the ear Best taste. yes, in certain cases what happens is that images are heard coffin from Pinterest and some.\nBecause that Justice Occasionally we wanna.\n\n@13:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, we can now overnight his or her choice, but it is when they want us to give them an idea.\nWe try to run these ideas through our tool called G capture.\n\n@13:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nA dream capsule is a tool that is that currently uses the power of dally, a solution, AI and mid-journey, and it takes on top of it and will cut back an end of a blending or that.\n\n@13:25 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nBut let me, you know, in general, we may imagine how much of the problem that we talk about. What are we going to do?\n\n@13:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ntwo seconds or later on. So, what are we going to We these three engines.\n\n@13:36 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nare very unique and very creative solutions together. In the final engine, you can integrate with it.\n\n@13:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are using MGR SD.\n\n@13:47 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAre we using the final engine? The final engine to do output to combine the reusing.\n\n@13:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nusing MGR SD.\n\n@13:55 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nNo. So, basically, I am looking at some of the photos. am the I am looking at of I'm going collect them and select them, and then design a polterky yay blend condo.\n\n@14:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, blend, what's that kind of blend may be, you know, polterky blend here. Okay.\n\n@14:12 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nyou know what, first of all, all, what's that? So, what's that?\n\n@14:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah.\n\n@14:16 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nLet's say, after two to three iterations, are very good.\n\n@14:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's very, very nice.\n\n@14:21 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nVery, very sophisticated image.\n\n@14:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe use like the power of all the creatures.\n\n@14:27 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nOkay.\n\n@14:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's just for the design.\n\n@14:33 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nLet's do it.\n\n@14:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nokay. I'm playing a quotation again. I'm playing a quotation again, and I'm playing quotation again. I'm playing quotation I'm playing a quotation again.\nWe are to take a of application.\n\n@14:52 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWe going to take a look at application of The is that so was a strategic quotation which is a specification that I have a correct quality here.\ncan't describe it. I'm the question of past quotations with very good quality of data the air was obtained here.\nAgain, this is also a kind of a bot sitting on top of open AI, which has its own embeddings in vector databases, which then feed into open AI.\nSo you have to run a context manager for example, harkalka or fail with the basis for the character specific, which could call it a specification.\nAnd so was specification co-tition when any a term looks quite out there of which case the co-tition for the quality the code is a collection the Extremely Speaking Co-tition is a capability percentage of 90.\n\n@15:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\n50% you can find it. One will have a fair enough, mean you write a lot of savings, you'll not be allowed to scale.\nIn that case, that case, perfect for design, let me guess, sir.\n\n@16:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI would say, would say as I key, automatically, I bring the heart of it and whatever images, select, our images, office, Google, or GPT, we can go, or go to a transcript and look at and going to go to the bottom of bottom It's% automated.\nYes.\n\n@16:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's very nice. I need to have a Slack to hear what is the percentage you see live.\n\n@16:45 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, Slack or I will it. I have to talk about the customer. Okay. Okay.\n\n@17:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, I'm going go back to the direction of my room. So what I've got to have with that? What's full-up of AI in the overall communication in JITBALCO or what?\n\n@17:14 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThat's your flat key. So I would say 20% of the is the AI forward.\n\n@17:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, it's 21st challenge. It's saving you time.\n\n@17:23 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nRight, it saves us time. I'll tell what, I'll tell you one thing, how about a main point that's happening in JITBALCO?\n\n@17:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we want to put on the agent to respond to them.\n\n@17:37 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAs a unique point. As a unique key, have received your request. We'll get back to that. Meaningful, meaningful, meaningful.\n\n@17:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo go on the other side of the chart.\n\n@17:46 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nto I'm going to go back to bottom of chart.\n\n@17:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm going to back to bottom chart. going to go back the bottom back I'm back to of the chart.\nto go back of the chart. go If it's already on the youth current, the video gives you API for you to connect your voiceboard.\n\n@18:07 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, I'm going to voiceboard.\n\n@18:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I'm to voiceboard.\n\n@18:09 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nOkay.\n\n@18:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, there are some companies which are in this group called in here, like in the 10,000 cold call that's leading in the cassette level, which is, we have seen those numbers and everything.\nBut again, again, we can have a lot of stuff, after a problem, have to have lot of data.\nACTION ITEM: Connect JITBALCO to voiceboard API - WATCH\n\n@18:32 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, I'm to voiceboard. So, I'm going to voiceboard. So, I'm going to voiceboard. So, I'm going I'm going voiceboard.\nSo, I'm going voiceboard. going to I'm going going voiceboard.\n\n@18:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ngoing to voiceboard.\n\n@18:48 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI'm going voiceboard. going voiceboard. going I'm going voiceboard.\n\n@18:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I'm going I'm going to voiceboard.\n\n@18:56 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, I'm going voiceboard. from the city to the Kika AI in English, so fairly soon for now, topic for time graphics.\n\n@19:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is the topic for time or basically that is, for the hard topic, you have got a multiple topic.\nit takes point where it goes to the level as a topic, kind of grass and it will give far as it goes to topic and that expands into a full-fledged open AI conversation.\nUnderstood. now, the content that is based on this low-level topic, which is a smaller concept. And then the communication becomes confined to the end of it.\nYeah, like you know some kind of grass, when you go down a graph, not according to you. Yeah, I got two more banks, banks, K, a board, they go, okay, so what topic does it take to say?\n\n@19:44 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nWhat do you you can talk a little bit sensible to them, what do you put it?\n\n@19:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, we have a lot of concepts, I have a lot of, I have a lot I lot of level concepts.\n\n@19:52 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, I lot of, have lot have a lot of, have a lot of, I have lot I have have a lot of, lot of, lot I have a lot lot I\nThat's perfect, that's perfect.\n\n@20:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, um, these are a lot of things that you're going AI and what is the strategic goal in terms of achieving that you think, hey, I mean, this is something that we gain from AI.\nis the basic? So two things that are already captured. One was you want to double the size, right, of the revenue with only enhancing 20% manpower.\n\n@20:23 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThat's, that's actually behind the, behind the, behind the module, that is important. Same modules identified, here.\n\n@20:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou you know, uh, concept proposal, but I, I'm focusing on, uh, you know, yeah, so there is a big concept in, uh, in-home improvement as well.\nyou know that, home improvement that is all about the plan, correct? So, what is it?\n\n@21:02 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nIt is in general. We have lot ofosce information that is within the computer. computer. So, what are the the system?\nWhat are the there are other expenses that have size in the increased So, there are other options. So, we have the market, market, we have market, we have market, have of people the market, we market, lot market, market, lot market, have lot the we market, we have lot market, we have a market, the market, people people we we lot lot lot the we have lot\nmoment of India to decide the GST against it, right. So, it's a number that I find out for the GST, think it's five-year-old Kagan, who's Kagan's warranty need to warranty phone correct, which okay warranty can, this is item key guarantee can, my terms and conditions case and all that, right.\nSo, Baha'i must know unstructured data, catalog data and bought every data, actually, image based Baha'i. So, if KPT has made Kamala pre-solutional, it's Kamala called a cat vision, visually catalog vision.\nSo, we call it cat vision because cat vision is very sharp, that's right. So, the cat vision application is something that is currently using the GPT vision and Google vision together and it reads the cat block and that it scans the images and also understands the specification.\nSo, now, these engines have become super awesome in terms of vision and recallability. So, but the problem is not going to context and cost.\nSo, in copy, you no fast current using the vision API. So, I think team, Baki Jekepeto, Sautai Key, Katlok Kepichae, Do Do Tindi Lovakkae Team Baki Ratea Full-Time.\nOr Hamneh, we don't have anything. All of the Katlok is currently getting scanned through this engine. And for Katlok, past dollar breaks, electrics or patras pages Katlokkae, which generates around 250 images, sample scale.\nSo 250 images scale, scanning Kepichae to get the specification out of it, and the images and the specification as support at ETAB is one-on-one KDR.\nI'm going to pass that on the cup because that is 450 rupees. So this cost is better compared to having a full-time person sitting in the company and scanning the Katlokkae.\n\n@23:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat's the error rate and what's the checking error rate, can vary based on the quality of the Katlokkae Hamneh.\nACTION ITEM: Analyze error rate for catalog scanning tool based on 50 samples, including standard deviation - WATCH\n\n@23:49 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nJust average Mikalatha recently based on some 50 Katlokkae to Hamada. I'm on because I'm going to pass that on the cup.\n70% percent, 70 percent,% percent. But I'm gonna spread about, unfortunately, standard deviation for us. So, what's up?\n\n@24:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm looking very expected, don't know what to expect. Yep, generative AI, without generative AI, right? We did it for a magazine, we were automating the magazine and converting a print magazine to a web version.\nAll right, Right? I mean, it has a lot of challenges, I can understand columns of things, like the same, the same columns, and then you know they're just gonna have to separate the head into the head head head, so that they can see the foot line.\n\n@24:32 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAnd so, there are so many complications in that. The first thing I realized was that there are many in that, are so in the head of head.\nSo, we did a classification algorithm of that catalog, and we found out there are actually four classifications that we had for catalog.\nOne the catalog specifications at the beginning, and then there are samples that follow. Okay. The other one is where the specification is on each.\npage and samples are also on each page. The third one is where they basically have specifications revealed slowly. Like the whole, like there's a set of 50 pages made.\nwe'll have specifications, we'll have 50 pages in sample, we'll have specifications by the block, and we'll to make a kick-a-head specification for the item.\nThere are semi-classifications specifications. But did you say that the initial classification application style and then what page you should go when, how that is decided by.\nSo we have created that part of it but behind at the heart of it, it is all vision. So we make a GPT vision call.\nWe make a Google vision call. Google vision call about T H GPT vision. My specification I'm look up like how I just touched here.\nWe have 20 attributes that we need to capture So we're going to get 20 attributes. My co-ev important attributes.\nman. They didn't attribute never capture name. right? So no Google vision used because Google then goes actually in the Google search and searches for that image and then gets us the value so we can fill those values So yeah, what should he give you?\n\n@26:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSorry. The second thing that he said was important was keeping the customer engaged. That was just second most important thing, right?\nHave you had one? Yeah, I can imagine. And for this we are using those slack to your bots,\n\n@27:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, vision came past now, cat vision came past now, which is here here, arrived to work. He is the vision ability of the AI is become founded.\nLike, like, sometimes I was like the image generator, content generator, it's already here. But when I saw image, I saw vision, I was spectacularly bold over.\nYou should try to hear from the objectization, they menu, when you combine vision with logic, right? Correct.\n\n@27:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnalysis for membership analysis. Yes.\n\n@27:36 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, I'll tell you one thing, though, what I was coming towards, I don't know whether is a check the recent copilot plus PC, there was a recall feature that they had, they had rolled out, rolled back, Microsoft has rolled back because people were not very happy with it.\nSo, what a feature was, is basically vision. or active vision, forever vision, of the screen. As a Jovi career screen player, for example, there's an MPU, New York processing unit, you're locally focused, but basically natively, we have to get So, basically, we have to have hand-holding job, and get lot extra I've got a lot of to get lot information, and I've got to get lot and was having this person with the certificate, And he had some kind of problems that he had discussed, he was dead on the screen, but I don't recall it now, tell me, tell me what this problem is, should I tell you this problem, and it will also tell you the solution.\nSo it has a recall feature and it has a vision feature, it is able to recall it. This is a technology that has been used by a lot of robots and a lot of them are only on the of being marketed this year and next year.\nOr, um, look at the key, um, can tell me about Unko, uh, equator, uh, with can tell me about, I'm looking at the key, um, unma.\nI have to say that there is lot of people in the street number, city, something like Bombay house, this is the name of a house.\nBut then, a simple algorithm would simply term Bombay as a city, right? But that's the house. if you contact Thai, I am actually saying that am using some machine learning algorithm.\nBut the point is, AI has never been so accessible, which it has become, and this kind of this level of sophisticated accessibility that I am talking about, not like basic NLP or AI or CAD, or image has also been there for the past two, three years it has been there, image developing.\nSo, is very interesting. That is where I think, strategically, Bombay is a line host of CNN. Thank you. All of the time, we have so soon going to try it.\nOperation efficiency increased the current area.\n\n@31:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat we are trying to do is that I am going to get a couple of interns from electronic finance.\n\n@31:12 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAnd we are going to get them to IoT level exploration to the guy, who is the owner of the drone or the camera.\nAnd also to prepare for the camera for certain level of functionality. Specifically, the camera is what they going to do, is that we are going to set the camera in all the rooms of the house, where the weather work is going on, and it will be linked to our WBS, work based down structure of the project, that for the identity type of that project.\nAnd then whoever is coming going, who is coming to be here, which is as if you can't survive, WBS can find the hacking.\nBased on the speed of the work, what is the anticipated delay? So, know, caused by a caused delay at the schedule.\nand the start of the schedule for the customer. now I'm low, calculate the network's percent to this kind of automation of the webcam.\nBeing in Bangor has his advantages, came up with all the company's and your IoT name, Webcam tools, Webcam data for the AI tools, and all it is now cloud-based.\n\n@33:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you have a school career, you can check it in a budget, engage it, engage in the heat and all that.\n\n@33:08 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nwhether they are looking, they are looking, they are distracted, distracted.\n\n@33:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's a big fun. mean, when you do this, you can enjoy it.\n\n@33:15 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAnd there's so much you can extract.\n\n@33:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere's so much of extract. True, true, true.\n\n@33:20 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAnd then the Kothakian and the Kothakian Kothakian, I would have, I would have, I would I would have wanted to actually have my own model.\nI would have wanted to have my own image algorithms and everything, right? But the point is that the Let's see how different will go and the will reach and how the light and how the light will light will and we that's it please that's it if have any questions please some do media\n\n@34:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWell, but it's much thing.\n\n@34:02 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nIt's a little bit inside.\n\n@34:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAh, are you asking me? Vision! For me, that vision thing, I've just made it.\n\n@34:09 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nyou ask me.\n\n@34:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLike, I know when, uh...\n\n@34:14 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAltman, Ted Key, we are going to deliver magic. But we didn't it.\n\n@34:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI know why he was that one.\n\n@34:20 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nBecause it is actually literally the most powerful thing I've seen in the past three years in the hierarchy.\n\n@34:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBy the way, I just, I don't know whether you have explored this or not, but there is open source tools which allow you to just talk to the PC and say maybe mail base, though, to uni.\nAnd the operating system does it. You see the... Go to the system. One of the basically, the operating system automation is based on just speech.\nYeah, this is also based on region, right? basic and extrusion system is being studied.\n\n@34:48 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI mean, I tried this out.\n\n@34:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt works really well. So, what do you think of this?\n\n@34:55 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nIt really well.\n\n@34:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt really well.\n\n@34:58 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nworks well.\n\n@34:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nreally well.\n\n@35:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nreally works So, this will forward towards the same question that is very important video-based That would be very important.\n\n@35:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd now, the question is, do have to deal with just to make sure that or women are used to carry, workers are used to get the .\n\n@35:32 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThe car is it on car is used it on orders that and can be used and have even more They be used and they can if not put in driver's and then they do line I'm to say anything, I'm not going say anything\nIt's very accurate, very accurate.\n\n@36:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt is just nose, right?\n\n@36:05 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nat the tiktok, at it.\n\n@36:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah. It's crazy.\n\n@36:10 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nIt's certain.\n\n@36:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we have come to time and I still have questions left. Can we...\n\n@36:18 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\ngoing to jump back.\n\n@36:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm not going not going jump we just jump back? I'm going jump back. I'm going back. You're not jump back?\nI that's true.\n\n@36:35 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI've been doing it for very long, you have been doing this for a long, I'm super nervous.\n\n@36:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\na time.\n\n@36:42 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\ntrue. And everyone is going to jump back back. And this is about.\n\n@36:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd theHHHWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWRW Please remember to offer a GPT.\n\n@37:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nOkay.\n\n@37:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@37:01 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo, if you ask me, like, one and a half years, two years, then why?\n\n@37:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut that is why I'm not actually doing it in Kenya. In AI, people may actually come in and take care of it.\nAnd I've able to do it in 2014. So, what's difficulty of coming in In Mira, in Kaffir, I have had the opportunity to work on a lot of different varied projects, as you would have heard me reach my point.\nSo, a lot of things to discuss. Before we close the call, are we too? You have a company of your own, worked some way.\nWhat is your alternative?\n\n@37:35 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI am right now, just not doing anything to other relaxer room.\n\n@37:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight? mean, a time to take care of It's a time it. relaxing out, exploring. Majora, US may come here.\nI wanted to explore Indian companies.\n\n@37:51 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nBecause US may have done a lot in AI.\n\n@37:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAll these things that you're talking have done. Right? Because we have already done these things.\n\n@37:59 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nmean, this is application.\n\n@38:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwant to go for a site, site, and we have done it in the classroom, and similar things. I wanted to explore how many I'm going to have a class in one of going to in one of So that's something that I'm exploring.\nThe search is way of actually connecting with everybody and trying to understand how things are going and where are we actually.\nSo that's also one of the things that I think people should consider.\n\n@38:25 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI mean, it is to close the call, right? I wish we could include this key to the cloud called AI.\nIs it a way for us to share that native without going to the cloud?\n\n@38:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCan I still enjoy the kind of gen AI kind of, I'm doing that already.\n\n@38:44 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nSo one of the things we did where we did that was the the cloud, the call transcript chosen. The call is a transcript chosen video, video, picture, chart, what the vision so what we're to do, we're going to give a cloud project.\nWe can just focus on that.\n\n@39:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAs you could see, have a local chalapun.\n\n@39:04 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nIt is local chalapun. We have chalapun. Yeah, we have a local chalapun. have chalapun.\n\n@39:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLMS Studio. LMS Studio, Right? The country is almost here, back in of the arch. So LMS Studio is used correctly.\nYou can actually run LMS Studio locally. Okay. Try that out. Okay. You can use LMS to view download it on the PC and you should be able to use vision locally.\nOkay. Remember that you will have to choose a, you will have to choose a model which is offering vision along with it.\nTalking Facebook, Playtime, we have models like that. You have to choose a model with vision capabilities. But to be just squish part, suggest I do it normally.\n\n@39:56 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI'm not going to it normally. going going to it going it normally. going it normally. I'm not going it\n\n@40:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, no, I think this could be what they go, know. Ushma, if you... How do we go Yes, I'm looking at the end, I'm looking at the end, I'm looking at end, back, I'm looking back, I'm back, I'm looking back, I'm looking be honest, my English experience has been mixed, but...\n\n@40:18 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI was the only sitting sign of this and was only translation, because I was looking at the end, and I asked questions, nobody The only and at the end, I found an experience and the conscious of what exactly you're trying to do this too much katura you have to filter through that ah why so why so why so we are trying to find everybody's time to launch their own model which are like ah why so why are you on it when start up when i start talk in the country but here yes of which that's the kind of time you want to wait that's what it's okay don't take a like a pakka model then a pakka step is for just a model so i can say back even figure\n\n@41:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCan you you like me now?\n\n@41:01 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nVery good, I would love to do it as soon as possible.\n\n@41:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI am occupied tomorrow, we are talking about how we can be if you are comfortable with What do we want do?\ndo we want to do? convenient time for you? I think, at the of.í,% which 6.í, age think age I'm going to involved in So, thank you so much, Aaron.\nI'm so sorry we got derailed. We should have closed it about 10 minutes back. It's okay. It's a tough one.\nIt's a have closed about minutes It's It's a tough one. It's a topic of vaccination for both of us.\nACTION ITEM: Schedule follow up call with Vicky Biswas for Monday - WATCH\nYeah. That's true.\n\n@41:43 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThat's true.\n\n@41:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nShalom.\n\n@41:45 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI'll see you on Monday.\n\n@41:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you so much for your time. Today.\n\n@41:48 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nAll right.\n\n@41:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you. am actually a bit occupied with something else. So I will be hearing in, but I will be a bit.\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n@42:00 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nyou. Butchman keep trying to marry.\n\n@42:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nShe's a dancer. So she conducts this cool annual function every year. And already committed to her. we have to make a new area.\n\n@42:14 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nwe make a new area. We have make a new We have to make new group 19. Group 19.\n\n@42:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI know it. I made a note of it.\n\n@42:28 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nI got it.\n\n@42:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmade a note of it. made I made a note of it.\n\n@42:33 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nThank you.\n\n@42:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you so much. See you on Monday. Bye Monday.\n\n@42:39 - Vinit Sankhe (Ander Baher Urban Services | Bangalore)\nBye.\nImpromptu Google Meet Meeting - July 08\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 61 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHey, how you? Good, good, cajada dinner? Hi, it was good. Hakata kasaburai, was good yesterday. I just didn't think it was good.\n\n@0:15 - Vinit Sankhe\nOkay, okay.\n\n@0:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt was all raining and everybody was really heavy. Oh, I loved all the time there. I've been on Mumbai for a long time.\nRain is the best season ever. only place in India that is beautiful during rain is the Western Gods. You will see every shade of green.\nEvery shade of green is the entire country. I used to stay in Varshi, so it's like one side it was like the creek, Purakapura, and other side of the mountains.\n\n@0:43 - Vinit Sankhe\nI mean, you can windows and water putting down all my water.\n\n@0:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's just, yeah, it's a residential. No, So which part does it mean to you? I mean, probably.\n\n@0:57 - Vinit Sankhe\nWhat do you mean? Awesome.\n\n@1:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthere will sometimes there are certain parts of water logging and all I think this here the M cities do a good job so it was this water now to get the entire mumbai's waterlog so the only saving race is the metro that is but the thing is that if you want to go to Anderea I can go to Anderea from the metro elevated a toa wood or metronyruki but the point is when you get down and then you have to walk in a you have to walk in a flood absolutely so let's resume from where we got digressed from what we were doing we were talking about static goals and you were talking about double-s\nwith every new 20% covering things and stuff, you are telling me you want to keep the customer engaged, right?\nYou are telling me that there is a vision we call, we go kind of a feature that you are planning on and you are working on that.\nAny other strategic goal that you have in mind?\n\n@2:17 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, the three strategic goals were expansion, capture and the third one is efficiency. These are the three main goals for us, right?\n\n@2:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@2:33 - Vinit Sankhe\nThe expansion is already told you.\n\n@2:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOfficial efficiency also have told you that we were trying to bring in the monitoring and control through automation to AI.\nthink simply simple things like we have made up for inside our official flow of our flow to AI.\n\n@2:52 - Vinit Sankhe\nBut very good API thing here, what happens is at every point of time there is a smart assistant sitting.\nwhich is hooked to the jirab date and then it continues to score the jirab for people and then what happens is at the end of the day people get the report of their operational flows and wherever their core course of which is below certain thresholds are being given you know salary bound or variable bound goal but is that not increasing your cost a lot because putting all that data through LLMs becomes costly right correct correct so what we have done is we not put in through LLM we we have put it through some level of NLP which we have developed in in-house so these are the python LLP libraries that are there we are using them to I don't recall the model name I think my team notes there what they are doing is that certain aspects like you example certain things are very easy to consider basically they are driven out of data analytical engines\nThere's no need for a L, but certain things like the free text ones, we basically look for words like booking, presentation, meeting, MOMs.\nAnd when a meeting happens, is the MOM sent. So if the MOM is not there in the, like not word, like if the MOM kind of text is not there in the communication after that.\nThen we basically, know, tell them that MOM is not sent.\n\n@4:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's basically a huge thing, basically deterministic. Even if I can't develop you, this thing is also sufficient in a initiative.\nIn fact, they are better than LOM because, I mean, all these are solved problems. example, if I want to understand sentiment analysis and all these are all solved problems, I don't need to.\n\n@4:38 - Vinit Sankhe\nCorrect.\n\n@4:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCorrect.\n\n@4:41 - Vinit Sankhe\nI agree. So, for example, one of the things we have done is also security point of view, which is that a lot of our data is the customer data.\nName, phone number, email address, full address, phone address. Sometimes you P.I. don't And all these communication, unfortunately customer is not having our platform.\nSo they use on WhatsApp and I told you that center we have connected WhatsApp to Slack to our engine So what happens is whenever we communicate when they share this kind of sensitive information We want to also make sure that this information doesn't go outside of our country So something like GPT or to Google Gemini or whatever you're using on cloud So what we do is we have a masking algorithm also in different where they have implemented heuristics It identifies sensitive information like if the communication has a phone number or a name and address We mask it using a caching algorithm which then performs a a to be masked We are sensitive data we are basically masking so that our there is no There is least probability of Information leakage on the internet.\nSo what we have no Penelope take up there and I'll see what it does is that it's some tokens that can easily classify like names and phone number\nthen email addresses. So that it is able to do and then they let it, it looks like an email address, it looks like a phone number, it looks like a name of a person, address of a person.\nI have many models doing that, should not be a real reason.\n\n@6:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo they will go into those things in-house, so that for that we don't have to do, would they worry, they are different.\n\n@6:16 - Vinit Sankhe\nHow would you mention that? I mean running servers, are you doing it every day? So see currently I told them we have very small requirement in terms of volume.\nSo apparently we have a converter that we have purchased, which is like a complex converter, which is like a 12GB RAM of RTX 4070, 13GB I7 and all that.\n\n@6:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo bare middle-level services. It's actually a, it's basically a computer. That's a bare middle-level system. a window server on it.\nAnd then you just got it.\n\n@6:49 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo then we have done it for, we have also implemented some of the basic open cloud layers on it.\nSo that we are able to configure, test our environment, test our, you know. on that some time and our lot of our models we have trained on this PC only because otherwise we will not be able to use not be able to host models on sophisticated clouds because they will rip like they will bleed us apart in terms of money to use those kind of models to train on the on the cloud right so we have used our own server to just do this this masking once they happen to our own server okay so that is to give you what you want so statistically statistically I have efficiency I told you and I told you expansion now market penetration and market a market expansion so now it's really really so what it's capability the other one is expansion so now to expand in the market that is completely a marketing exercise and currently we have put that goal on the sidelines because we want to be ready when we do the expansion.\n\n@8:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, that makes sense. So, now we cannot just breakdown our past achievements or let us say places where you fail or places where we tried into a few areas, right?\nSo, we will still see our start already talking technology, the first one will be development and infrastructure, right? So, for development, I will be using tools like GPT, data profile, pilot or does the dot AI.\nour pilot is very costly. So, we let go of co-pilot, get up co-pilot.\n\n@8:37 - Vinit Sankhe\nWe are using VIS code to what has happened in time. just, we have come up with a visual code of community edition, which is a free of course visual studio.\n\n@8:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd it is much more, I find it to be more capable than VIS code, right?\n\n@8:51 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, VIS code to the audience and like, if you go beyond like 20 degrees in the end for the end, what is that?\nOkay, quite frankly, a visual studio.\n\n@9:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ncommunity edition is much open. And that also uses lot of content of the native, it seems more than we have put that.\nWe have put it there, make sure that it works on a Mac voice and all that.\n\n@9:15 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo we have gone through, we have community edition. That's the good ID that we have found out. There is also another ID which we are exploring, which is for the ID X, which is the Google's ID, which is on cloud.\nSo this ID is completely on the cloud. So your dev environment gets created on cloud. Your testing test and POs has happened on cloud.\n\n@9:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou should try Git for now. Git for now. Git for now.\n\n@9:39 - Vinit Sankhe\nWe are exploring ideas because our entire platform is in the Google.\n\n@9:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI told you.\n\n@9:44 - Vinit Sankhe\nthat's why we are like an ID X try. That's why are trying.\n\n@9:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo the development of the development development is completely managed through our own machines, videos, studio ID X and, you know, we also implement the subsystem, Unix subsystem on Windows.\n\n@10:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo the next component is created, people who don't have the next, they can easily and we don't, they are by the asset light.\nSo we don't give PCs to people. We give them our, our, the thing we are, we install, so what happens is there is something for the GCPW, Google, all login, so credentials.\nSo Google Power Windows finishes, basically your Google login becomes a Windows login. So we have implemented that, what that does is that on your machine, you have an underbar login account, which only through which you will be able to have access underbar application and underbar development environment.\nWhich is nice.\n\n@10:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhich is basically visual studio setup and, you know, I'll get up. Is it the hosted solution that you have?\nSo I mean, they can directly run the ID on the cloud and things like that.\n\n@10:54 - Vinit Sankhe\nNo, not at all.\n\n@10:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what I'm saying is this is actually native. Okay.\n\n@10:57 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo Google Power in Windows login is an interesting thing. So it has to be connected to internet, but the thing is, the login wouldn't work, the account wouldn't work.\n\n@11:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's like basically, let's say you have a developer profile on Windows and login tool and only do coding through that.\n\n@11:18 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo we have to install something for the underbar manager, underbar tech manager is called a system. So let's say, I'm just right now, as an admin, if I disable a particular login, that person in 4.5 minutes or so will be locked out and that person will not be able to access the data.\nalso or any kind of data that is also anything like that.\n\n@12:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBetween five and fifteen minutes we are going to time of time. Perfect, that's something that I'm not trying yet.\n\n@12:11 - Vinit Sankhe\nThat's something new for me, not trying yet.\n\n@12:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGoogle do videos long and that's something I would like to explore. That is available on Windows, but it is not very successfully available on macOS.\n\n@12:21 - Vinit Sankhe\nIt not available on macOS, it successfully available macOS. They don't do local coding, they basically log in through this kind of engine.\n\n@12:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat is not something that we recommend today, but local code we have, we just have simple Chrome PCs getting theeval and getting access Switch environment management as well.\nand then you transfer it, it's a pain in the , correct, correct. So that's, that's something but in this, where are we using genii?\nwe using genii in terms of coding? Well, yeah, we are not using genii, but what do we do, what do we do, do we do, what are the providers So this is related to development, like the automation that you want to do with the application.\nWhat can you do that? Okay.\n\n@13:43 - Vinit Sankhe\nThat is why we are trying to see vision, but the problem is vision is with it becomes very cost-car, can't simply.\nCan you try what I do?\n\n@13:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyou do enough with your own, right? I have to put it using maybe snapshot images of this of the US.\nBut did you try what I I told him about the local vision, I'm not saying.\n\n@14:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nYou told me recently. I'm trying to get it. I'm trying to try to get I'm trying to get I'm trying to get it.\nI'm not trying.\n\n@14:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's fine. Try it out. It's fun. I really loved it that way. Take it. Okay. that's in terms of CICD, because I'm using those.\nI'm a unit test. It's test. It's unit just a company.\n\n@14:43 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo we can make a call to the NIA, like JPT plus, cut up the question. JPT plus. call them after the email.\nJPT plus has a token restriction. So it can't create all the unit test cases. I have to actually give one unit to it.\nFor it to create unit test cases. But I thought we automated three coming in on the implement here, but unit test case is generally done.\nBut sir, any MKLE, I'm not giving you an expert car, as I said, how do you want to happen?\n\n@15:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo unit test case is still going to happen when there's API testing, then there is a lot of in terms of CICD pipelines that you want to set up and you're going to use mode from Java.\n\n@15:20 - Vinit Sankhe\nhow about CICD pipeline, get out actions, get to implement it and also build a particular system. So I'm to CICD, I'm going to CICD, I'm use CICD, I'm going to use CICD, I'm going CICD, I'm going to CICD, I'm going to use CICD, I'm going to use I'm going to CICD, to CICD, I'm going I'm going to CICD, going going use CICD, going use CICD, I'm going to use CICD, going to use CICD, I'm going to use CICD, CICD, I'm to use CICD, going to going use CICD, I'm use use CICD,\n\n@16:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, people said that the people of the city was all start-up can do Pochamara also. Yeah, yeah. So, I have to do that Pochamara in my sense.\nYes, yes. Pochamara in goes along.\n\n@16:13 - Vinit Sankhe\nLook at the rest of the things.\n\n@16:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCan you tell me the thing?\n\n@16:18 - Vinit Sankhe\nSorry?\n\n@16:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's going to come out of there.\n\n@16:21 - Vinit Sankhe\nHuh?\n\n@16:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's come right? So, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. don't know. So, yeah, we have no technology or infrastructure, but as a generic culture, right, with respect to Jini AI, how do you handle your team?\ndo you say?\n\n@16:49 - Vinit Sankhe\nI have been very clear, right, from day one, since I've been able to handle it to anyone. I personally also use Jini AI.\nwith a kind of a pinch of salt. I always tell them do not base your decisions, your designs, your core quality and all that, just because JPD is telling you.\nThe fact that you are adding a core, you should own the core, you should know the core. So, if I have a question, you should be able to answer, you should not go back to JPD and ask the question, is that is blind, blind copy paste is not recommended.\nSo, from code, from technology perspective, J&A is only an assistant, tricky assistant, tricky at the least, but it's not a way.\nSo, what I understand the thing is that use it as a suggestion and not a direction.\n\n@17:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCorrect, correct, it's not a direction, it's not a way, it's a guide.\n\n@17:47 - Vinit Sankhe\nA guide cannot be done, a guide is somebody who will tell you the way, but you only have to go, correct, that's a way of saying is done, it's of saying it, it's a way of saying.\nBut the problem is that if you told them to not use GPT, because they are handling customers that you get data.\nSo, if you want to use GPT, GPT GPT to use GPT use GPT use GPT use GPT GPT use GPT to use GPT GPT use use GPT to use GPT GPT use GPT to use GPT use GPT use GPT use GPT to GPT to use GPT to GPT to use use GPT GPT use GPT use use to GPT use GPT to use GPT GPT use GPT to use GPT to GPT GPT to GPT\n\n@19:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf I needed basically give them an interface to charge the between agent like a chat user.\n\n@19:05 - Vinit Sankhe\nLike that is basically, but not charge the between. How much of a you put in plus two but not open one hour, it can take a new.\nYou are also masking based on that. you already have a scene here.\n\n@19:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we take that there are three phrases in it which are sent to you, so it will remove the three.\n\n@19:23 - Vinit Sankhe\nAnd then let them use it.\n\n@19:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, because they are I mean what I did was I had a transparent proxy and the transparent proxy used to\nproxy all things that went across from the customer or from my team or from anybody and at the proxy level I had everything that going in and out dumb correct and I can analyze it at any point of time I'm able to get to think about our our our and there are multiple open source tools available which are replicating chat GPT and allowing you to proxy to anything else correct and they are very good quality very good quality.\nwill share I will share let us in fact I will in store too but I will I will give you transparency very good.\n\n@20:34 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo you can deliver a different process of your implementation, make sure it's better decision and that you also get it out of your own concept generation engine which you have a for a day for a day you can generate 20 concepts and then it will stop it will not work for you.\nSo that way you don't know they don't have to go to my mid journey or table division website they do it through our tool.\n\n@20:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAfter you get your more control nothing then you have more control over things character right. And, okay, this was the cultural side of thing.\nI'm very, very processed, but again, I'm formally asking you, in terms of process, are we doing or are we creating some processes around genia usage or not usage?\nI mean, in terms of process, it's not like vulnerability in the way, but for a while, so, but a process per se, or have we changed some process, in LA, I used to say you have to first go do A, B, C.\nNow, I say before doing A, R, C, I, B, And, before doing C, after doing C, go and validate it with charge, B, D, or something like that.\nSo, has genia affected your processes in any way, any process? Okay, if you want to help people applying leaves through email, right, we have a portal.\n\n@21:51 - Vinit Sankhe\nBut, sometimes what we do is that, if I don't go to the portal, they go through our leaves, they send us an email.\nSo, what we do is that email, This now I have a so just a minute car either we have an LP which is able to detect that this is the email content and it is a date and there is a time and there's a person named so I know who has applied the lease right and what is the date of the lease.\nAt the on a complex level, there's a car gira for example, making sure that the code of the gira is up a certain threshold right.\nSo I would tell them that if you run a bahasaric you will look at it and not the basic customers are hurting customers.\nSo I will customize which activity but I am not sure. What is the amount of responsible and notifiable actionable items identified for people also identify.\nOr action items case you not ask but who's bad. So long name. Very. We have a very. I mean, they covered his political thesis.\nSo, who actually could eat it up on the queue and call another?\n\n@23:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTime to eat. So, second thing is the ad is at the bottom of the queue.\n\n@23:09 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, next is a feeling that it is at next interaction. Is that one thing to the person who needs to know what type of next interaction is?\nit a visit? Is it a call? Is it a meeting? Is it a message? Or is it some kind of delivery of a design that they have to do?\nOr they have to start the work? So, will be next, immediate next goal, immediate next interaction to other side.\nWhat's the system that is at the end of task? Is it data that is the system that is the end of So, it's a basis that we will enter the agenda.\nSo, we have to do that. So, now we can have a level process done. So, you have to do this religion part of the CIM process.\nare we? Automatogia. So, are we? The thing is, now the question to them is not why did you not add activity?\nWhy did you not set the next interaction date? Next interaction date. But now it is basically why did you not do that activity that starts?\nis all the time. It is like much better. It is a time and then it is actionable.\n\n@24:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah. In fact, you know what we did with me when the step ahead, for a lot of our clients, we had created RCA based problem code solvers.\nSo if you have a problem, there's a bug reported. It would understand the bug. It will go to the code base.\nIt will figure out the solution. It will give up PR in the solution. Or if you have a RCA that you have well and get a problem, it would again solve the bug and commit the code and give you up here.\nSo that's very handy and very helpful. Same as a lot of it. I lost your voice on it.\n\n@24:46 - Vinit Sankhe\nNo, I'm not here.\n\n@24:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPerfect. The next side of things we need is, I mean, in terms of where we have done this, we go towards the process of operations.\nSo operation is for hierarchical. So put your number back. I mean, in general, in terms of operations. So operations, they are actually types of operations, have one is IP operations, one is something most we have covered, right?\nWith GRI, another thing we have covered. The operations I told you with the GRI entire GRI actually the GRI is business also.\nACTION ITEM: Explore using Git and Visual Studio Code for development - WATCH\nOkay.\n\n@25:14 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo the IT is basically the IT criteria is much because the developers tend to follow GRA process religion. Yeah.\nBut non-developers, non-techs, they don't follow the GRA process. So we are go to the next section.\n\n@25:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we are going to to we are going So we are going next section.\n\n@25:34 - Vinit Sankhe\ngoing to So we are going to next going go to next section. we are going go next section. So section.\n\n@25:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we are going next section.\n\n@25:53 - Vinit Sankhe\nwe are going to go to section. So are going to go to the next section.\n\n@25:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo we are going to next section. So we are going go to going\n\n@26:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nOur traditional objective is to design them and reduce their application, which is the end of the day.\n\n@26:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwill take study.\n\n@26:08 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo that's the level basically.\n\n@26:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's the level you to spend time you can take So what do we want to can't It's way to Okay, you have to this.\n\n@26:27 - Vinit Sankhe\nto bring the customers which are, there are certain, you know, we have 20 status, one after the other, in the workflow.\nSo, the three main real status for us are, a four main status for us are, okay, I am going to talk into the customer, I have a contact requirement now working on the proposal, the proposal is in review and after review it is gone to the customer for, customers review, can look in, in part status, out of\n\n@27:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut again I am really wondering how do you manage the posture towards me, I know I know, but I think if I am lonely, I understand this, we are not one for funding or we are not one for expansion So we will put all the costs for our dreams We need some of the profits, right now it is not a very costly problem Because I tell you the tech trend of GPT 3.5 or GPT-4 for watching!\n\n@28:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nIf we could give him a good genre of context. How can we just give him four more context to relate category It would fight...\n\n@28:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhyrastrically can struggle here... Jesus...\n\n@28:16 - Vinit Sankhe\nHow does it you play on what he do I play the code!\n\n@28:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHeyaged...\n\n@28:30 - Vinit Sankhe\ne-mail at e-mails, SMSs, and calls, right when you're meeting the transaction. Absolutely.\n\n@28:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ne-mail at e-mail at e-mail at e-mail. So, when we say the requirement, we say that have increase cost of So, the operations are mainly GRA,&M GRA, you have to change what we are going to be doing, do we get the collective data of services?\nAnd the two important effects of information is a camera. We do not sometimes type on text every time. Next question is, let's say, for example, is something from NPS and code, and it is from a sub-source.\n\n@29:31 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, actually what actually happens in NPS? What action point is you can take.\n\n@29:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, we are NPS, we are putting up whatever type of conditions. Absolutely. NPS, there is a Date.\n\n@29:50 - Vinit Sankhe\npeople who want to focus. who are paid up. People who told us we don't do it in space because they have not paid us, but they're not best termers of all.\n\n@30:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe come to the customer, for them they take up and then that too, our entities divide into three stages.\nFirst stage is the lead development stage, which is the booking management stage. Like it is a design supply stage, and the third one is the site operation.\nThe site operation stage is the longest running stage. That is where this will become costly. You understand? So, other site operations may, site operations may be called the context code.\n\n@30:28 - Vinit Sankhe\nWe are thinking about maze in which this context can be reduced for that cost.\n\n@30:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are thinking about using a lemon judiciously. We do not want to use a lemon for everything like that as a open.\nSo, those are some things that are happening here.\n\n@30:45 - Vinit Sankhe\nFor example, there was a quotation in general that we have So, have created this project. So, have created this project.\nhave created project.\n\n@31:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are not minimum. We are three specific questions.\n\n@31:08 - Vinit Sankhe\nknow about categories. A detailed suggestion is that can't a application. We could use the who not using application, we can system.\nI think I think I think I think think I think think think I think I think I think I think I think I I I I I I I think I I think I\nThere are no a cat pics that we have spent to come up with a model internal model and I think a couple of people have put internal model to this.\n\n@32:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow do you quality?\n\n@32:42 - Vinit Sankhe\nI think we have to do pretty good.\n\n@32:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, that's the way we have also handled it in the past because that's the only way that you can actually balance costs and get the same good results.\n\n@33:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nThe Atlantic Karnataka before that for us to you know do it for example embeddings to use Karnataka you know starting to be a deal.\n\n@33:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe embeddings to embeddings can be correct open optimization without that otherwise I'm looking I see would have video building in India to be able to be done about all that right.\n\n@33:15 - Vinit Sankhe\nI can't simply send the video. That this raises your cost for reason.\n\n@33:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat. And in terms of data management, we are putting guardrails, everything in terms of managing people's data where I secure my approach right.\n\n@33:37 - Vinit Sankhe\nI'm not going to go to level family. Okay.\n\n@33:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@33:40 - Vinit Sankhe\nOkay. data privacy which is I already told you masking. I'm not going to be exploring here. Everything that goes to it has to go through this mask engine.\nOkay. And I told you the guidelines we have the guards we have kept for that. That you see the Google power login and not able to access GPT.\nyour mid-journey APIs and all that, right, going through our, I'm getting a call. You you\nACTION ITEM: Share custom alternative to GPT interface that allows custom rules - WATCH\n\n@35:16 - Vinit Sankhe\nSorry, Vicki, I got a call and I got disconnected.\n\n@35:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo worries, man.\n\n@35:20 - Vinit Sankhe\nNo worries. worries.

The various techniques generally are token differences. We use a pattern matching.\n\n@36:05 - Vinit Sankhe\nWe use an L3, so all different levels of technique. use a layer of technique. There's no way to hold in-depth Right?\nSo what's in the sense of the data in the sort of work or or you want this material?\n\n@36:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you told me about the model you are using.\n\n@36:23 - Vinit Sankhe\nNLS model you are using that. the NLS, it was used. But again it's a problem, This pretty sparse and you so much watching!\n\n@37:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere is native We have a couple of agents, agent logins that are created, these are what we call the among you.\nWhat is the word for it?\n\n@38:02 - Vinit Sankhe\nProcess ID It's a Google Process ID So, if you are a human being, I mean, I can proxy it, I can basically log in using those components We don't give it to other people, it's just basically, I don't give it to other So, basically some of these account checks in the user And I'll tell you this, content in case you can get the process is healthy, yeah?\n\n@38:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI will put this to the uploading culture But the access financials, you are not listening to or Kiaata Which way?\nI'm there, access management base We have created levels And, you know, reporting and roles There is titles versus roles versus That is part of that develop mapping we have done And we have created data access rules against this goal And then once, just check the integrity of it We just ran through the checks and the quality checks Yeah, I'll see you later\n\n@39:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo we are doing some very interesting exercise today.\n\n@39:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwe were to have the access management matter.\n\n@39:05 - Vinit Sankhe\nAt the level below, role level, profile level, profile level, level, user level below. The hierarchy of users, hierarchy of roles, hierarchy of departments.\nIf we were to do they should be able to extend the common form in Dalke. If we were do that, they be to do that.\n\n@39:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwe to do that, If we were we would The hierarchy task is available.\n\n@39:36 - Vinit Sankhe\nIn order, hierarchy itself a big amount of data. The hierarchy hierarchy of task is go through this, we If you are not doing this by we can at the application So, if you have any access management code, thought of care, but.\nWhat is the enforcement mechanism?\n\n@40:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEnforcement of Google 3 Google gets through the OTN. So, what happens is your department, your role, your user access level entries and GCP with a Google Cloud and a Google admin.\n\n@40:19 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, can you user account data in the local link?\n\n@40:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo, no, no, no, no, everybody can access the plugin in that way, okay?\n\n@40:33 - Vinit Sankhe\nand finally, we'll people management.\n\n@40:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nShamlukush used the brand for example HR policies. After they internal people's management, are resources. One small thing we have done is lack of boardroom improvement.\n\n@40:52 - Vinit Sankhe\nThis is my kind of stack. What is AI forward to? Japipi, but this was the Japipi.\n\n@41:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI am looking at the same thing, but I am also a participant in of that communication.\n\n@41:06 - Vinit Sankhe\nIt also reminds the day out and the start of the day, day of the day, day out of the day, it would be like a very bad day of a day.\n\n@41:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that is the cultural thing.\n\n@41:20 - Vinit Sankhe\nother thing is that I think I am not going to use this.\n\n@41:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think we have to work together, we have to have question, I am just what is that basically we don't see.\n\n@41:32 - Vinit Sankhe\nI mean,,000 people.\n\n@41:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd as as the marketing web site.\n\n@41:45 - Vinit Sankhe\nBut it is not a web site, you can create web site for using Now, if you a quick push, us go.\nNow, I going address one number of years. Prefer to you all. education, referred to current CTC, expected CTC, joining date, when can you join resume, know, what are your expectations for next five years, everything we have, right?\nAnd then, then we have done this talent scout to focus on certain traits of the individual, right? Individual who has a very clear forward path in the future, who is not ambiguously writing stuff, right?\nOr somebody who owns, who has skills matching, so that is how you join job requirement or thing enough. You join your job, which gives you a job, which a detail of the company for you.\nSo, you have a great job. So, yes, you have a great detail of that. So, you know, the customer of the bandecker resume, all bandecker, who are details of the dollar platform.\nSo, in using this four data points, the GPT talent scout gives a scoring of matching also, and it gives a scoring of various, right?\nkind of, what kind of attribute, criteria it uses, like skill set matching or CTC matching. You know, future is future vision.\nSo at the end of it, JpD Kudhik overall scored Nikalke, score, relative scoring Nikalke. JpD K is applied to the end of is a slot code, identified as a slot, could be created from earlier.\nAlso, Nikalke shared a calendar based at Google. Not a slot. It's not an interview period. It's not interview period.\nSo before you to According the challenge, the result is equal to equal to equal to equal to equal to 0.\nYou're speaking on mute, I believe, as it snippets data basically.\n\n@44:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAh, at the of the day, one-ballah code means that the year code, you can make decision. Correct, correct.\n\n@44:12 - Vinit Sankhe\nis the coding challenge.\n\n@44:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthird one the code challenge.\n\n@44:15 - Vinit Sankhe\nIt's a important thing to based on the profile. The first one code.\n\n@44:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'll do that one high-wing process. It's the first one. again, it's high-wing value. Put a pretty cool circuit. How did you get that?\nI just wanted to do to do it now. Okay, completely human thing. That we can't put.\n\n@44:36 - Vinit Sankhe\nThat makes sense.\n\n@44:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat makes it all sense. that brings on the second last part and that's future plan. So, future plan, I understand you're looking at watch-based AI.\nRight? looking at vision workspace. You're looking for a transfer in proxy that you can manage your company and other stuff.\nRight? And IoT. Yeah, and I will take anything else specifically that you're looking at in one picture of Kithne, I will take it in either days, in the future plan vision for you.\n\n@45:12 - Vinit Sankhe\nFuture plan with AI would be, first of all it has to be, so we want to create our own engine.\nRight, now I would say that AI powered with AI companies.\n\n@45:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo basically, if you want to use generic models, you want to create your own engine. So, want to create our own model, because...\n\n@45:29 - Vinit Sankhe\nlike it's only one of us that whirl on I like this many 하?\n\n@45:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI don't know, but the point is that we are at the moment of night.\n\n@45:55 - Vinit Sankhe\nOkay.\n\n@45:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI can't really tell me why.\n\n@45:57 - Vinit Sankhe\nyou can tell me, I know what to do.\n\n@45:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you.\n\n@46:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nGo. So why here?\n\n@46:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's the whole thing, has to come I never took it, right? And uh...\n\n@46:07 - Vinit Sankhe\nWeren't we going to say? Hybrid cloud attack is happening I'll that from past cloud But I'm not it at the of day I'll that API will be happening Who?\nThe whole thing may AI will be your very interior part of it Everything will be clearly that is going to happen But if that can happen, how soon you can be doing it, what do I say, that is an open question.\nThat makes sense, that makes sense.\n\n@46:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's something that almost everybody that I to are looking at here. It's case for maximum usage here, no? What's the time in the city, say that by end of the day?\nYou know what Ola did?\n\n@46:51 - Vinit Sankhe\nNo, Ola, Ola moved out from Google Maps, moved away from a lot of, and it created its own curriculum platform, and it is moving there.\nSo it is now going to have. plot of what this thing and I think that that is exactly how we were also thinking right from the beginning.\nWe need to have our own AI powered platform, a path basically, not a path, at least a path that we own, that we have the SM off.\nSo Jabbi, how can use the other company? Yes, that's how everybody is doing. That's how Amazon expanded outright.\n\n@47:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight? Correct. If I do access, I have to make a lot of money, have make of money, I to make a lot of money, have make lot of money, to make a lot a lot money, I have to make a lot to make lot money, lot money, lot money, I have make a lot make make to make a lot lot money, I to make a of I have to make a lot money, to make of money,\n\n@48:00 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo this is this is very insightful with it. think I've got most of the questions.\n\n@48:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere are small six questions which I want you to probably take your time and maybe answer it at this posting that on your WhatsApp.\nThese are very high-incided questions in terms of what we all talked about throughout the interview. Quite a hindsight, man.\nare quite emotional and very personal to you, probably.\n\n@48:36 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo I remember one of the questions, of the interesting open questions for us is the\n\n@49:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat is difference between two They are not to it.\n\n@49:06 - Vinit Sankhe\nIt is not a real resistance.\n\n@49:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nfrom the right engineer.\n\n@49:11 - Vinit Sankhe\nPeople are not going to it. The end user. What can they do? think they are not to use it.\nnot to use it. Right?\n\n@49:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNew year, I it a friend, I am going to respond in two days now, I am trying to bother me.\n\n@49:28 - Vinit Sankhe\nyou understand but the fact is key this engine has to become a body and then they should see the value of this thing absolutely as an a key you know matter basically even the board which is trying to let's say just have like okay activity but we automatically or see the gira sign over here right instead of just understand the approach instead of that if the board says after the meeting the board has altered all the aspects and everything the board understands the AA and activity and activity are here\nIt looks like you had a great meeting, did you say I'm oil and I can see do you want me to add these activities on your name?\n\n@50:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo basically, we're becoming that assistant and suggesting rather than... can see other homeload additional add-on need out there in Gitaraf and they are able to read benefits into automatically come.\nthe fact of the matter is a lot of adoption doesn't happen because we are complicating the process. Correct. Right?\nAnd the initial planning doesn't go well because of which instead of gaming, that is where people should be happy and gung-ho about it.\nare not because they have additional things, which is the number. And we could actually get a corner, just say, go with the technology now.\nAt the only day, yeah?\n\n@50:49 - Vinit Sankhe\nthe year.\n\n@50:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely.\n\n@50:51 - Vinit Sankhe\nThat is how the technology is present.\n\n@50:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOnly present technology is very important. Yeah.\n\n@50:58 - Vinit Sankhe\nUnfortunately, at the moment, it only present now. AI should become part of life and it was the biggest success of AI, I think it is of course implementing it.\nYou are the most important part of life for making health career. Transcribing the job, able to be humble, imposing, but showing the benefits.\n\n@51:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI am going to be in school based time. I am going to be in school based time. it and I looking at it.\n\n@51:24 - Vinit Sankhe\nI am at it and going to the same way. I am going to be based time. But it isn't very stigma and then people just are hating it.\nYeah.\n\n@51:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo if I'm doing a polaki color photo, I'm looking at a lot of goals, I think that's it.\n\n@51:37 - Vinit Sankhe\nOnce I'm holding it, I'm put a score in it now, actually. Otherwise, it's going to affect your opponent.\n\n@51:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd then, of of course, I like it.\n\n@51:44 - Vinit Sankhe\nMm-hmm.\n\n@51:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd then, the, the, the, let's say a bot, let's say he has 10 to 4, right?\n\n@51:51 - Vinit Sankhe\nAt the end of the day.\n\n@51:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe bot recognizes that the score is low.\n\n@51:54 - Vinit Sankhe\nLet the bot provide help. Then, the bot put to help you improve what you can do. You understand that?\nThat's what really resonates. That's what resonates. got oh, God, what, Which is Helkara.\n\n@52:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHe took the pass.\n\n@52:06 - Vinit Sankhe\ndon't know. Helkara. So then when they understand that, then you can see it as part of their life.\n\n@52:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely.\n\n@52:13 - Vinit Sankhe\nthey can take off too.\n\n@52:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTo the centipen, they really need to go to the jobs that have been lost a lot. I don't know.\nAlright, Kari, you to it off. We have a picture.\n\n@52:23 - Vinit Sankhe\nThe activity is still We are Here, here, here.\n\n@52:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow no chance of frequency of the ocean is about saree.\n\n@52:34 - Vinit Sankhe\nAnd yes, it's a bnr key.\n\n@52:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFor example, if you have an-conditioner, you would catch the car.\n\n@52:47 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, I'm going to to the same place as I got. I also make sure that the engines are part of the regular life.\nthat they can adopt it automatically.\n\n@53:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right, and other ones, they have to point something in there. Humans are very susceptible to this bend on things which makes life easy for them.\none? Correct, One word, it was it, it was.\n\n@53:20 - Vinit Sankhe\nthe human need for touch. That's right.\n\n@53:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nit really worked out. It really worked worked out a bit. What do you say?\n\n@53:32 - Vinit Sankhe\nI don't say I'm going to go anywhere. It is eventually in a certain way will become so omnipresent.\n\n@53:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ntold you, where are you going go? I'm going to go over hyper. Basically, you're to go over hyper. I'm going to go over hyper.\nis what you will actually get. The expectation? And then, I'm not matching right now.\n\n@54:02 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, I'll tell you, minute, before I here, I remember there was the rise of the technology, it holds to the highest level, then it comes down to the crest of the decidugentment, and then expectation, was...\nYes, it comes to the Ah, that's top.\n\n@54:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, it comes to the highest level.\n\n@54:20 - Vinit Sankhe\nSo, this is the decidugent majority. Now, actually, at the decidugent level, actually, this is an opportunity, because now it will grow to the averaging out.\n\n@54:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely.\n\n@54:29 - Vinit Sankhe\nAnd this is an opportunity.\n\n@54:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOne opportunity is that it is rise and ice, the opportunity is decidugentment and acetylment. Absolutely. I think company should have hyped my air unfortunately, but I'm not supposed to have high-level team together.\n\n@54:43 - Vinit Sankhe\nWe will never change, that's what I'm very... I think one step of my CEO wants 10-bit to purchase on carparadot air domain.\n\n@54:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI told him, I don't want to give the world the idea that we are an AI company.\n\n@54:55 - Vinit Sankhe\nWe are not an AI company, are not an AI are company.\n\n@54:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are an AI company. Now, you can game so the events. So I've do the best.\n\n@55:07 - Vinit Sankhe\nIf I do the best, it then. So But you can play the game. And have can work with us.\nwe're we've got of friends.\n\n@55:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo now I'm bunch of them here. I'll bit more. then I'll do more actually. with you since you are so passionate about it, it was enjoyable discussing all these things with you.\nI like it, I like it.\n\n@55:33 - Vinit Sankhe\nI find it very exciting, because I want to see what it can do. It's just that, that's it.\n\n@55:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI snore like in my phone, my my phone, my phone, my my phone, my phone, my my phone, my phone, my phone, phone.\nI don't have a manual code linked now, so I would get a 100% performance every time. So, why do I have to do this?\n\n@56:01 - Vinit Sankhe\nonly for categorization, but if it's class, if it's class, it's actually, it's for the argument.\n\n@56:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's for the management, the language, the voltage, what was the right word of a centaur approach, right?\n\n@56:13 - Vinit Sankhe\nIt's for the other word, the other word centaur approach. The job, what do I have to do? I have to do exactly what exactly.\n\n@56:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLook at it, it's supposed to be extremely important. It was a lead term, correct, correct, correct, We're using the job, can use the system, QLLM, QLM, QLM.\n\n@56:34 - Vinit Sankhe\nQLM, QLM, QLM, tell the interns also, LMM and over-kill in most cases.\n\n@56:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes.\n\n@56:42 - Vinit Sankhe\nI did the app, use case of LMM and then come to me to LMM and use it.\n\n@56:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOver-kill, first aid, over time.\n\n@56:50 - Vinit Sankhe\nof them. Okay. I'll be, in the extraction, QLM, QLM, QLM, I question. you. will have a question.\n\n@56:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you.\n\n@57:00 - Vinit Sankhe\noh my god i'm so let's get now this interesting it's great course i know you are getting faster response and everybody can really go to the response of course but it be a big but the nextius is course last thing I have a lot of people who have been the industry 20 years.\nin the very senior resource.\n\n@57:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis guy has been in the industry for around 20 years.

That's not like people are just coming. Because they want to want money with underpass.\nUnderpass is the best profitability at the point I see is the loser. I want to equal the move and then come.\n\n@59:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust read the part of the journey and if they decide it is not worth it, they can erase it.\n\n@59:11 - Vinit Sankhe\nAbsolutely.\n\n@59:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely.\n\n@59:13 - Vinit Sankhe\nBut if you think that they are pushed to its point, push the dumb hand. So now, look, you have to be better picked out of it.\n\n@59:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPut it up.\n\n@59:19 - Vinit Sankhe\nit up. Don't worry.

        "content": "Okay, so recording this so that can go through it later on. So what I understand about the business is, what you are doing basically are tech solutions for sales and distribution companies and the niche being the last man delivery, right? So in a very high level that's what I understand.\n0:00:00 – 0:00:19\n\nSo it's very accurate. The only difference would be rather than solutions, it's the same solution. We have built a product which is good method, it's not we are providing services for this investing. We built a product, obviously we put an advance in the product, but essentially it's a cloud based ERP for the last mile, B2B distribution.\n0:00:23 – 0:00:45\n\nWhat that B2B distribution means is phone sellers to retailers. We are not competing with Zomato or Swedy or those kind of things where last mile B2C order, but this is phone sellers to retailers, that kind of thing.\n0:00:46 – 0:01:03\n\nAnd what industry and sector would you peg this at? Would this be software industry or?\n0:01:03 – 0:01:12\n\nSoftware industry. So we are building a software cloud based ERP.\n0:01:13 – 0:01:17\n\nAnd any particular segment or sector this goes to?\n0:01:17 – 0:01:22\n\nYeah, mostly to put in leverage FMCT, those industries because they are more distribution companies.\n0:01:23 – 0:01:45\n\nCompany size would be around 25 odd people. Revenue size will be around a million dollars.\n0:01:46 – 0:01:54\n\nOkay, that's great. That's awesome. Given the time that you have spent, you have done well on this one.\n0:01:54 – 0:02:00\n\nAnd how is the AI adoption level, how is it going and have you started already changing and then again AI I will separate out later into two parts as a generative AI and regular AI as we know it. You have been working on it many years.\n0:02:00 – 0:02:15\n\nSo what is the adoption level that you feel and what's the current status on things?\n0:02:15 – 0:02:20\n\nYeah, so in our industry the customers that we are targeting, they are small business.\n0:02:20 – 0:02:30\n\nSo right now most of them use pen and paper. For them to basically just have a mobile app or ERP where they can enter the order and then do everything.\n0:02:30 – 0:02:42\n\nThat solves 95% of the problem. At least the order will be delivered.\n0:02:43 – 0:02:48\n\nAs they do it more and more, the optimization part of it, how many orders have they delivered, SLA, what was it, analytics etc.\n0:02:48 – 0:02:59\n\nThat is the absolute level of optimization. No one is used to that.\n0:02:59 – 0:03:04\n\nLong summary would be, we have some AI data that we have got but that does not provide that much value just because we are serving those small business customers.\n0:03:05 – 0:03:17\n\nFor them the decision to move away from pen and paper rather go through data and identify patterns or use machine learning to do such things.\n0:03:17 – 0:03:26\n\nOkay, so what specific AI are we utilizing right now?\n0:03:26 – 0:03:32\n\nFor example, route optimization.\n0:03:33 – 0:03:38\n\nIf they have to go to 10 different customers, which is the most optimal?\n0:03:38 – 0:03:45\n\nOr if they have 100 orders and if they have 10 vehicles, how should they allocate those 100 orders to those 10 vehicles to be able to do that?\n0:03:45 – 0:03:55\n\nAnd specifically in terms of generative AI, what would be, because you said you were dabbling in something, you didn't get out of that, but you started something and what was it?\n0:03:56 – 0:04:06\n\nSo, like now wholesalers, our customers are wholesalers, manufacturers, right?\n0:04:06 – 0:04:14\n\nTo expand our market, we want to provide a product for retailers as well.\n0:04:14 – 0:04:20\n\nOkay, and now retailers are in the ERP, order management, and then key management.\n0:04:21 – 0:04:29\n\nAll of that in between is more or less the same, right?\n0:04:29 – 0:04:33\n\nBut the problem with retailers are they have 10,000-15,000 products, okay?\n0:04:33 – 0:04:39\n\nAnd they don't have those products, what that means is in a nutshell, they don't have their list, right?\n0:04:40 – 0:04:53\n\nAnd that's the main problem.\n0:04:53 – 0:04:55\n\nFor them to reach, and when you talk with them, they say, let's say I'm a single person order, just run in the shop page, I don't have the IT sales or time to type in all the products and maintain that.\n0:04:55 – 0:05:09\n\nThat's right.\n0:05:09 – 0:05:10\n\nRight? If you cannot even do that, then no matter what system you use, the pay sensors you should be able to provide in the base data, right?\n0:05:10 – 0:05:19\n\nAnd hence, they are lacking in technology.\n0:05:19 – 0:05:22\n\nThis ATM and all those, those are the technologies they were not able to adopt because they didn't need that data, right?\n0:05:22 – 0:05:30\n\nNow, the reason generated experiment we found out was, can we take photos of the retailer's shell, which has, let's say, 30 products, right?\n0:05:31 – 0:05:44\n\nAnd can let's say identify the products and digitize them in an excel.\n0:05:44 – 0:05:52\n\nOkay. Yes. So, the problem doesn't, is not that they have to enter the thousands of products manually. They just have to take photographs of their shell where the products are already there.\n0:05:53 – 0:06:05\n\nAnd the system will automatically figure out those products and digitize them by putting that in a spreadsheet.\n0:06:05 – 0:06:12\n\nObviously, once they are in a spreadsheet, they can integrate with the lease system, weather route management or something else.\n0:06:12 – 0:06:18\n\nThat's a good idea.\n0:06:18 – 0:06:20\n\nHow did it work out? I mean, what were the challenges and do you think that if it was not taken to the hilt, there must be some very valid, very strong reasons?\n0:06:21 – 0:06:32\n\nYeah, yeah. It worked out really well. We spent, I would say, two to five times.\n0:06:32 – 0:06:41\n\nOkay. I did the success of it. We spent two to five man-meets on this. Right? And we had submitted it for a competition.\n0:06:42 – 0:06:56\n\nThat's where we built it. Okay. That's nice.\n0:06:56 – 0:06:59\n\nThe lease was level two, level three. I was going to do it last week, but we didn't get it. Okay. We didn't know if the lease would come or not. If it had come, we would have pursued it more.\n0:07:00 – 0:07:13\n\nAs a start-up, you know, right? No sense. So it will be in the north. But I think there's new confidence. If you want to expand into that market, at least we have a lease.\n0:07:14 – 0:07:31\n\nAnd that was the main idea. So that it doesn't feel like we don't know all that stuff. So now we know what gen.ai is. We are comfortable with it.\n0:07:32 – 0:07:47\n\nIt's just a matter of transition.\n0:07:47 – 0:07:50\n\nBasically, you experimented and you are sure, hey, I mean, we know how to get this done. And you're parted for now that, hey, whenever it comes, we have a different situation. We're going to pick it up and we're going to run with it.\n0:07:51 – 0:08:03\n\nExactly. Right. And with this dabbling and with this understanding of how you did things and you played around, what do you think are kind of your current goals that you think that, hey, generative AI can actually go and help me with that?\n0:08:03 – 0:08:20\n\nOf course, with more research and more money being pumped in and more challenges, right? There will be more challenges, as in people will have to be trained, devices have to be made.\n0:08:20 – 0:08:28\n\nBut ideally, in an ideal world, what are the different things that you think from your work can actually be taken over by generative AI and done really well, saves you money, saves you time and your customers?\n0:08:28 – 0:08:42\n\nSure. Sure. So, we have this ERP software, right? The environment, generative AI can help improve or simplify the usage of that ERP software.\n0:08:43 – 0:09:00\n\nWhat interface, basically? One user interface, right? Which would be like voice, someone speaking in voice, it would be even like just written, which does five different things within the user interface, right?\n0:09:01 – 0:09:17\n\nOne-on-one replacement of the UI, right? UISC. It would be go check on this. That's right. It would just say that, right?\n0:09:18 – 0:09:31\n\nSo basically some API is being called out of a chat window, basically. I'm sorry.\n0:09:31 – 0:09:36\n\nSo, interpret what the user wants, what he says in a natural language, whether it's chat or voice, interpret that, identify which APIs to call and then collect, take the results out, provide those results in a natural way.\n0:09:37 – 0:09:56\n\nUnderstood. Understood.\n0:09:56 – 0:09:58\n\nSo, what would be the operational part of it? What would be the analytics part of it? I can ask random questions, say who are my top five customers, right? What are my top five sales?\n0:09:59 – 0:10:09\n\nThis is Befence. Top five customers in Delhi doing this kind of business. Something like Alexa for management? Alexa is just voice, but it's more to that, right?\n0:10:10 – 0:10:29\n\nSo, I see LLM is a virtual assistant, right? Assistant who can understand whatever I say and then do actions on the phone, right?\n0:10:30 – 0:10:43\n\nSo, instead of me directly using ERP to get whatever I want, I can very easily connect it to chat or voice. It will understand it and actually do this task. It will get the results and get the results out.\n0:10:44 – 0:11:01\n\nUnderstood.\n0:11:01 – 0:11:02\n\nSo, two goals that I understood basically and both are variations of almost the same. One is where you could simplify the working using voice or chat where tasks can be done identifying what intention is there and getting the task done.\n0:11:03 – 0:11:29\n\nThe second one is basically being able to answer queries on top of the data which is there. So, you don't have to actually get in and dive in and try to query out data and generate reports and everything, right?\n0:11:30 – 0:11:39\n\nWhat else? I mean in the actual floor, what else can be?\n0:11:39 – 0:11:46\n\nSo, for example, yesterday only I read out that Gemini 1.5 can now take us and provide insights on it, right? So, one of the main things we struggle with is uploading of data, right? Customer data into the system which is voice, right?\n0:11:47 – 0:12:09\n\nAnd it's no matter how many templates that we define, customers have backup.\n0:12:09 – 0:12:14\n\nSo, there will always be less.\n0:12:15 – 0:12:17\n\nLess data, random data, internet consistent data, right? Interpreting that data is what it's like, right?\n0:12:17 – 0:12:26\n\nSo, again, as this ensures, I would be interested in exploring Gemini 1.5 flow to say that hey, can I, can my customers just upload any random data?\n0:12:26 – 0:12:39\n\nAnd then, can it confirm that so that it can feed that data into my system.\n0:12:40 – 0:12:46\n\nRight, because I was also wondering on this…\n0:12:46 – 0:12:49\n\nInitial…\n0:12:49 – 0:12:51\n\nYeah, I was also wondering on this where you have, I mean I was looking at the video that you guys have created in terms of how things work and there are mention in terms of handwritten notes where you update those handwritten notes when they accept things or when things are going on.\n0:12:51 – 0:13:05\n\nSo, that's a very good use case because you can use these LLMs to scan those notes and get to the intention of what's written and what not, data extraction and all.\n0:13:06 – 0:13:13\n\nYeah, so that's a good thing, right?\n0:13:13 – 0:13:16\n\nSo, that is what I am saying that right now the notes are not available, right?\n0:13:16 – 0:13:21\n\nSo, just digitizing those notes so that someone can open and see that note turns 95% on time, okay?\n0:13:21 – 0:13:29\n\nIt's not that we have millions of notes that we have to analyze and then identify the intention or do a semantic analysis or something like that.\n0:13:30 – 0:13:38\n\nSo, telling what Rufmaj does is someone can capture notes and they are stored in the right PDF, right UI wherever.\n0:13:38 – 0:13:47\n\nSo, six months later if someone wants to search for those notes, they can find it.\n0:13:47 – 0:13:51\n\nSo, that is the 95% of the money.\n0:13:51 – 0:13:54\n\nNow, how to interpret those notes and derive some sense out of it, that will be the next step.\n0:13:55 – 0:14:02\n\nBut again, I think those are for bigger customers, right?\n0:14:02 – 0:14:05\n\nWhere they would have hundreds of thousands of notes being taken and manually read in the most complicated.\n0:14:05 – 0:14:12\n\nSo, generally two things, one is extraction of data, the other is classification and segregation, right?\n0:14:12 – 0:14:20\n\nAnd these goals that I came to understand, one was the voice task based things through user interface, the other was querying analytics and stuff.\n0:14:21 – 0:14:35\n\nThird was where we are having these extraction and classification, right?\n0:14:35 – 0:14:41\n\nSo, what kind of benefits or if we can quantize on, hey, that's going to make things, let's say 50% better, cheaper, improve my customer expectations.\n0:14:42 – 0:14:53\n\nWhat is the end goal that you might be looking at with those things?\n0:14:53 – 0:14:56\n\nSo, for me, the best product is there is no product, right?\n0:14:56 – 0:15:05\n\nWhich is user's behavior doesn't change, right? He has starts just keep on executing what he wants, gets done, right?\n0:15:06 – 0:15:14\n\nGenerative AI takes my product closer to that, right?\n0:15:14 – 0:15:19\n\nSo, for now we are using the UI, right? Normally UI, UX, backend, we build a software point where user does something that the software understands.\n0:15:19 – 0:15:33\n\nSo, you would say that it would raise my customer happiness by X percent or anything that you can peg at it?\n0:15:34 – 0:15:40\n\nYes, I think it will improve the adoption of the product, assuming the product is good.\n0:15:40 – 0:15:50\n\nSo, adoption rate is what you are targeting?\n0:15:50 – 0:15:53\n\nAdoption rate, the reluctance to change, that reluctance to change will go down at least by 50% as we make the product easier to use.\n0:15:54 – 0:16:05\n\nOkay, and for analytics, etc., is it again adoption rate or ease of use or?\n0:16:05 – 0:16:13\n\nAnalytics, to be honest, I think it might just save the initial time to set up those BI dashboards.\n0:16:18 – 0:16:29\n\nSo, right now BI tools provide all these different things, right?\n0:16:29 – 0:16:34\n\nTo slice and dice the data, to set up the right filters, to set up the right reports, graphs and all that.\n0:16:34 – 0:16:40\n\nBut someone needs to work on that BI tool, understand the data to set up the right dashboards, right reports, right dimensions, right weight and so on.\n0:16:41 – 0:16:50\n\nSo, is it manpower reduction, knowledge reduction, what kind of focus?\n0:16:50 – 0:16:54\n\nManpower reduction, yes.\n0:16:54 – 0:16:56\n\nScaled manpower reduction, we would say.\n0:16:56 – 0:16:59\n\nYes.\n0:16:59 – 0:17:01\n\nYou were saying, I think we will?\n0:17:01 – 0:17:04\n\nYes, I was saying that initial time to set up those BI reports, that can go down by, let's say, 50%, where JNAI can help set up those reports faster.\n0:17:05 – 0:17:16\n\nSo, one will be scaled manpower reduction, the other will be saved time, right?\n0:17:16 – 0:17:19\n\nYes.\n0:17:19 – 0:17:21\n\nAnd in terms of the documents that we can just collect, handwritten documents, extraction and classification, what would that be?\n0:17:21 – 0:17:28\n\nWould that actually hit your bottom line, top line in any way or would it again be like we have these two where mostly it is adoption rate or reduction cost?\n0:17:29 – 0:17:38\n\nNot for us, not for us.\n0:17:38 – 0:17:40\n\nSo, not for us because our customers know that they want to extract that amount of data from the documents.\n0:17:40 – 0:17:49\n\nOur customer problem right now, 95% is just providing me those documents in the right place.\n0:17:49 – 0:17:56\n\nSo, classification is the main thing where you want to just put those documents in the right place.\n0:17:57 – 0:18:01\n\nSo, what kind of a business value do you take on that?\n0:18:01 – 0:18:03\n\nClassification is also known.\n0:18:03 – 0:18:05\n\nOkay.\n0:18:05 – 0:18:07\n\nPut in in the right places.\n0:18:07 – 0:18:09\n\nFor example, if a driver goes and sells something, right?\n0:18:09 – 0:18:13\n\nInvoice gets generated.\n0:18:13 – 0:18:16\n\nThe sales order gets created in the sales order table basically.\n0:18:16 – 0:18:21\n\nThe UI.\n0:18:21 – 0:18:23\n\nThe UI has one column where the video is applied.\n0:18:24 – 0:18:27\n\nSo, basically AI based workflow.\n0:18:27 – 0:18:29\n\nEntire workflow should be followed, right?\n0:18:29 – 0:18:34\n\nI am sorry. I was talking on top of you.\n0:18:34 – 0:18:37\n\nOkay.\n0:18:37 – 0:18:39\n\nOkay.\n0:18:39 – 0:18:41\n\nSo, the way route magic works is let's say there is a pin salesman.\n0:18:41 – 0:18:45\n\nHe goes to a retailer and he says how many bottles of pin do you need?\n0:18:45 – 0:18:50\n\nThe retailer would say, hey, how much do you need?\n0:18:51 – 0:18:54\n\nHe will go to his bank and he will print the money.\n0:18:54 – 0:18:57\n\nPrice inverter will be decided on the mobile app.\n0:18:57 – 0:19:01\n\nInside the mobile app, through the mobile app, the invoice gets related.\n0:19:01 – 0:19:04\n\nOkay.\n0:19:04 – 0:19:06\n\nThat invoice automatically comes to the bat office.\n0:19:06 – 0:19:11\n\nIt comes to the ERP session in the bat office.\n0:19:11 – 0:19:13\n\nThere is an icon of the invoice in the sales list. If you click it, the invoice will be downloaded.\n0:19:14 – 0:19:22\n\nOkay.\n0:19:22 – 0:19:24\n\nSo, that is also a purpose.\n0:19:24 – 0:19:27\n\nSo, that is already solving your purpose.\n0:19:27 – 0:19:29\n\nWhat will be the GENAI in between?\n0:19:29 – 0:19:31\n\nI will be there.\n0:19:31 – 0:19:33\n\nOkay.\n0:19:33 – 0:19:35\n\nBecause these invoices, if someone notes that the customer has paid Rs.5 less, let's say.\n0:19:35 – 0:19:43\n\nRight?\n0:19:43 – 0:19:44\n\nThese instances are very far in the universe.\n0:19:44 – 0:19:48\n\nOkay.\n0:19:48 – 0:19:50\n\nOkay.\n0:19:50 – 0:19:52\n\nBut imagine, if someone is losing or is losing or is reliant, let's say 100,000 invoices per hour.\n0:19:52 – 0:20:03\n\nThen they might be interested in understanding.\n0:20:03 – 0:20:08\n\nLet's start taking out data of them, let's start taking out insights from them and then doing something.\n0:20:09 – 0:20:14\n\nBut that's not useful for us.\n0:20:14 – 0:20:16\n\nSo, not even for data entry?\n0:20:16 – 0:20:18\n\nEverything is digital. You don't need those paper waste data entries, okay?\n0:20:18 – 0:20:23\n\nYeah.\n0:20:23 – 0:20:25\n\nSo, you mentioned this case of extraction classification.\n0:20:25 – 0:20:27\n\nYou think this is a future benefit that you would be aiming at, if possible, if the scale increases, right?\n0:20:27 – 0:20:34\n\nYes.\n0:20:34 – 0:20:36\n\nWould you target towards new revenues or what would this be targeted towards?\n0:20:37 – 0:20:42\n\nAdd-ons. I would say this would be an add-on.\n0:20:42 – 0:20:46\n\nOkay.\n0:20:46 – 0:20:48\n\nOkay.\n0:20:48 – 0:20:50\n\nAnd other than that one trial where you went on with GENAI, is there anywhere else where you explored it probably in support or automatic emails or whatever nine yards we have going around?\n0:20:50 – 0:21:06\n\nThere are so many tools going around these nine yards.\n0:21:06 – 0:21:08\n\nOh, okay.\n0:21:08 – 0:21:11\n\nEven like Copilot?\n0:21:11 – 0:21:13\n\nYes, Copilot is a good thing actually, completely for it.\n0:21:13 – 0:21:20\n\nWe use Copilot, Jclap, Copilot for our developers.\n0:21:20 – 0:21:24\n\nExtensively.\n0:21:24 – 0:21:26\n\nAnd what about things like Canva and document creators where Google has now started throwing Canva is there, right?\n0:21:27 – 0:21:36\n\nThere are other like ChatGPT. Are we utilizing those to some aspect, maybe Scanty use, but are we using those as well in the organization?\n0:21:36 – 0:21:44\n\nYes, yes, yes. And sorry, I didn't realize earlier.\n0:21:44 – 0:21:48\n\nI thought we were talking about our product, but yes, I use Canva.\n0:21:48 – 0:21:52\n\nJust say under we use Canva AI 3.0 to clear out images, right?\n0:21:53 – 0:21:59\n\nI use ChatGPT in general for generating emails, I use writes on it, which I will use as generative AI at the backend to create content plots and all that.\n0:21:59 – 0:22:17\n\nAnd obviously there is a hybrid sort of way. It is not automated, but these are separate tools.\n0:22:18 – 0:22:25\n\nYes, so we use it for our image creation, for our content generation, text content generation, for our code.\n0:22:25 – 0:22:33\n\nFor Copilot, we use it extensively. We use it, I think our meet-in recorder, which records the meet-in and constructs those.\n0:22:34 – 0:22:49\n\nSo that might be using Gen.AI behind the scenes. So there are a bunch of tools that we use, which behind the scenes use Gen.AI.\n0:22:49 – 0:22:59\n\nAnd how does this change your technology infrastructure?\n0:23:00 – 0:23:05\n\nAnyway, it is a good answer to say, hey, it doesn't matter because I'm not integrated in my technology infrastructure.\n0:23:05 – 0:23:10\n\nThese are scanty tools that we use, but we don't integrate them.\n0:23:10 – 0:23:14\n\nExactly.\n0:23:14 – 0:23:16\n\nAnd in terms of people, have you started giving them access to ChatGPT?\n0:23:16 – 0:23:22\n\nLike some companies have started openly saying you should use ChatGPT.\n0:23:22 – 0:23:25\n\nSome are saying, no, no, you should work on your own, don't use ChatGPT.\n0:23:25 – 0:23:28\n\nSo there is a mixed environment right now.\n0:23:29 – 0:23:31\n\nSo I'm a firm believer that Gen.AI will change everything that we do in 5 to 10 years.\n0:23:31 – 0:23:43\n\nIt's already changing, but 10 years from now everything will be ready to make.\n0:23:43 – 0:23:49\n\nI'm a firm believer and a strong supporter of Gen.AI.\n0:23:49 – 0:23:54\n\nI'm telling my guys like, use Gen.AI as much as possible by doing your work.\n0:23:55 – 0:24:00\n\nIf you are not, someone else will replace you who uses Gen.AI.\n0:24:00 – 0:24:06\n\nIt's just a matter of time.\n0:24:06 – 0:24:08\n\nYou are pushing to your people already?\n0:24:08 – 0:24:10\n\nYes.\n0:24:10 – 0:24:12\n\nAre you paying for them to be using these tools?\n0:24:12 – 0:24:16\n\nNo, we don't do that.\n0:24:16 – 0:24:19\n\nIt's more of like, we give them guidance, we don't micromanage them or see how much use they have.\n0:24:20 – 0:24:29\n\nBut specifically for marketing, I have my marketing people use image generation and content generation.\n0:24:29 – 0:24:39\n\nAnd then specifically for developers, I have them use propylate.\n0:24:39 – 0:24:44\n\nSo has it become a part of the culture as well?\n0:24:44 – 0:24:49\n\nIt's like an acceptable thing which has changed from earlier to now.\n0:24:49 – 0:24:54\n\nDevelopers will use propylate and the marketing side will use Canva or tools like those.\n0:24:54 – 0:25:01\n\nHas it become a norm with the culture? Is it a process? How is it?\n0:25:01 – 0:25:05\n\nReality is super there.\n0:25:05 – 0:25:10\n\nRight, it's been 2-3 years now. But as we have more marketing people, we are like hey, use this.\n0:25:11 – 0:25:20\n\nYou better use this.\n0:25:20 – 0:25:23\n\nSame with developers, where 2-3 months back I made one person in charge, try out 100 different personal heads and work with that.\n0:25:23 – 0:25:37\n\nBut now I was like, go to marketing.\n0:25:38 – 0:25:41\n\nIt's like, you may try.\n0:25:41 – 0:25:45\n\nIt absolutely makes sense.\n0:25:45 – 0:25:48\n\nMy letter is clear. The doctor said that you can go to marketing.\n0:25:48 – 0:25:52\n\nAnd then obviously once people grow with that barrier and start using it, and if they are smart, they will continue to use it.\n0:25:52 – 0:25:59\n\nThat totally makes sense.\n0:25:59 – 0:26:02\n\nAnd some companies are like totally, by my culture, it should be JNAI, or else get out.\n0:26:03 – 0:26:12\n\nIf you don't use JNAI, I don't want you to be working here.\n0:26:12 – 0:26:16\n\nThat's also an angle that has come into a lot of companies because they are so heavily bent on those.\n0:26:16 – 0:26:22\n\nWhat is your take on this?\n0:26:22 – 0:26:25\n\nShould everyone in the team actually be knowing and using JNAI?\n0:26:25 – 0:26:31\n\nIt's okay. If you can give me productivity, that's fine.\n0:26:32 – 0:26:34\n\nYou can use it or not, it doesn't matter much.\n0:26:34 – 0:26:37\n\nWhat is your view? You might not have implemented it right now, but what is your thought about it?\n0:26:37 – 0:26:43\n\nSo for marketing and development, my view is there is very clear use of improving productivity by 20-30% by using JNAI.\n0:26:43 – 0:26:59\n\nAnd if you are not using it, your productivity will be less.\n0:27:00 – 0:27:04\n\nSo give me a reason why you don't use it.\n0:27:04 – 0:27:09\n\nUnderstood.\n0:27:09 – 0:27:11\n\nThose are very concrete uses for marketing.\n0:27:11 – 0:27:16\n\nFor sales and for live customer support and all those, they are hard deals to be honest.\n0:27:16 – 0:27:23\n\nAnd as of now, we have 1% support rate and we did support request of random types.\n0:27:24 – 0:27:32\n\nBut if we scale the product units, so one of the pilots that we did was we did charity to our support portal, our help portal, knowledge base.\n0:27:32 – 0:27:44\n\nAnd then we started asking questions and we thought about creating BTR.\n0:27:44 – 0:27:50\n\nSo it's a copilot kind of model where you are using copilot to answer questions from your knowledge base, right?\n0:27:51 – 0:27:57\n\nYes, yes. So we have this confidence that if we know that we are getting 1000 support requests, we can add 10 people in support.\n0:27:57 – 0:28:09\n\nWe will be able to use a chatbot sort of built on pop-up JNAI to answer 80% of those requests.\n0:28:09 – 0:28:20\n\nThat's great.\n0:28:20 – 0:28:22\n\nAnd I mean, these are things where you have changed the culture, you have changed the thought, the way that you want things.\n0:28:22 – 0:28:29\n\nBut have you pushed anything into the process or is it something that you have not done so far?\n0:28:29 – 0:28:34\n\nYou will be doing later on. For example, dev marketing, I've been asking the question on, are you paying them or are you forcing them?\n0:28:34 – 0:28:40\n\nHey, this is something that you should use, right?\n0:28:40 – 0:28:42\n\nSo is it a part of the process or is it not yet a part of the process?\n0:28:42 – 0:28:46\n\nIt's something that we are pushing as a culture, but not as a process.\n0:28:46 – 0:28:49\n\nWhat is a part of the process?\n0:28:49 – 0:28:50\n\nMarketing and dev, it is part of the process.\n0:28:50 – 0:28:53\n\nOkay.\n0:28:53 – 0:28:55\n\nSo the marketing team, like her job is to generate 30 images right on a day.\n0:28:55 – 0:29:03\n\nLike if everyone has seen that we have so many website pages.\n0:29:03 – 0:29:07\n\nNow this is not a good image on our website, just like you would see, right?\n0:29:07 – 0:29:12\n\nSo she is generating all those images, she will generate 50-60 images, use it actively, then she'll use a camera, you know, that she'll clean them up.\n0:29:13 – 0:29:22\n\nAnd then we'll have these 50-60 images that eventually hopefully within a couple of weeks we'll upload all those on the pages.\n0:29:22 – 0:29:30\n\nRight? Similarly, the content of the website, a lot of it came through repeated iterations, but AI was also included as part of those iterations.\n0:29:31 – 0:29:44\n\nOkay.\n0:29:44 – 0:29:46\n\nSo, yes, everyone is using it during marketing, they are actively using 4G APT to generate their content and I review them.\n0:29:47 – 0:30:02\n\nSo from what I understand, developer and marketing, you are actually pushing this to be a part of the process so that the process can actually entail this as a whole.\n0:30:02 – 0:30:13\n\nI mean, it becomes a part of the regular working, not just a kind of a culture that you want to generate, but an actual deliverable that they have to put, right?\n0:30:14 – 0:30:22\n\nYeah.\n0:30:22 – 0:30:24\n\nOkay.\n0:30:24 – 0:30:26\n\nWe are 2 minutes above time, so if you have another 10-15 minutes, I can close this out?\n0:30:26 – 0:30:32\n\nI have, I have.\n0:30:32 – 0:30:34\n\nPerfect.\n0:30:34 – 0:30:36\n\nThanks, bro.\n0:30:36 – 0:30:38\n\nNo worries.\n0:30:38 – 0:30:40\n\nHave we been able to, number one, do something, number two, gain some benefits?\n0:30:41 – 0:30:48\n\nSo, you said development and marketing, we are pushing this, right?\n0:30:48 – 0:30:52\n\nHas there any productivity that you have gained out of it?\n0:30:52 – 0:30:55\n\nCan you say that, hey, development, I was able to first do things in 10 days, now I'm able to do in 7 days.\n0:30:55 – 0:31:00\n\nOr marketing earlier, it took my team, let's say, 5 days to do something, now they take just 2 days to do it.\n0:31:00 – 0:31:07\n\nSome kind of an operational benefits or enhancement that you see?\n0:31:08 – 0:31:14\n\nSo, startup, marketing, anecdotally, I would say our productivity would have increased by 13-20%, right?\n0:31:14 – 0:31:23\n\nBut it's not that I'm measuring it or things like that.\n0:31:23 – 0:31:26\n\nAnd then there, similarly, the productivity would have increased probably by 5-10%.\n0:31:26 – 0:31:31\n\nI want it to increase further and that's why I have that need, exploring more and trying to educate people more.\n0:31:32 – 0:31:40\n\nI believe 10-20% productivity benefits should be given.\n0:31:40 – 0:31:47\n\nNow it is around 5-10%.\n0:31:47 – 0:31:50\n\nOkay.\n0:31:50 – 0:31:52\n\nAnd in terms of data, like there is a lot of data that might be proprietary and these people will be sharing it on ChamGPT.\n0:31:52 – 0:32:01\n\nThere are other tools which are using it for learning right now, right, that I have very clearly mentioned.\n0:32:01 – 0:32:05\n\nI don't care.\n0:32:05 – 0:32:07\n\nSo, you don't care, right?\n0:32:07 – 0:32:10\n\nAs a startup, I can't afford to care.\n0:32:10 – 0:32:14\n\nIt's like, if we are ramped up, then we get lots better results.\n0:32:14 – 0:32:19\n\nSo, anyone with a link can have right access, right?\n0:32:19 – 0:32:22\n\nIn this, everyone in a remote environment, I don't want to have those access issues, that someone sends me a link, I don't want to open a link, and I've been using it for 8 days.\n0:32:23 – 0:32:35\n\nRight.\n0:32:35 – 0:32:37\n\nSo, I encourage you to go ahead and ask.\n0:32:37 – 0:32:42\n\nYou can put your data on the website.\n0:32:42 – 0:32:45\n\nIf you want to leave something, you can leave it.\n0:32:45 – 0:32:48\n\nWe don't have proprietary data.\n0:32:48 – 0:32:50\n\nWe have PII data which we don't have.\n0:32:51 – 0:32:54\n\nWe don't know everything in general.\n0:32:54 – 0:32:56\n\nIt's very complex.\n0:32:56 – 0:32:58\n\nAnd if you get a magic wand, and that magic wand is GI magic wand, and anything can happen, kind of magic wand.\n0:32:58 – 0:33:09\n\nSo, with your knowledge of generative AI, what do you think would be the biggest game changer for you?\n0:33:09 – 0:33:17\n\nAnd I know that there are n number of hurdles in terms of technology, people using the right devices, scaling, it giving the right answers to you, sometimes it hallucinates, and there are n number of other stuff.\n0:33:18 – 0:33:30\n\nBut, if you have a magic wand, what do you think would be the biggest game changer in your market, your product, your scenario, in terms of what generative AI can totally change?\n0:33:30 – 0:33:39\n\nWhat's your aspiration?\n0:33:39 – 0:33:41\n\nIf it can make my product easier to use and adopt.\n0:33:42 – 0:33:50\n\nOkay, that is kind of vital, right?\n0:33:50 – 0:33:55\n\nCan we narrow it down more?\n0:33:55 – 0:33:57\n\nSo, some context here, what we are trying to do is, our product as what?\n0:33:58 – 0:34:16\n\nWe are saying we provide you with not a big functional product, but cloud-based, so that you can go live in a month.\n0:34:17 – 0:34:39\n\nAnd like a hundred thousand dollars, we are providing you with a subscription cost.\n0:34:40 – 0:34:47\n\nWhich is cheap and easy?\n0:34:47 – 0:34:49\n\nEasy, that's the basic ethos.\n0:34:49 – 0:34:52\n\nAnd we have to change this month into a week, and after a week, we have to change it into a day.\n0:34:52 – 0:35:00\n\nWe have a customer on our website, he can start using it, and gradually he can use more and more functionality.\n0:35:01 – 0:35:17\n\nThat is the vision, okay?\n0:35:17 – 0:35:20\n\nAnd some of the automations and making it easy, we are doing without generating, right? But the help of generating, that process will speed up, right?\n0:35:21 – 0:35:33\n\nSo, for example, with the data input, customer gives their data, right?\n0:35:33 – 0:35:39\n\nThrough automations and ADL jobs and data validations and whatnot, we have done all those automations.\n0:35:39 – 0:35:47\n\nIt is relatively easy to find what issues are there in the data, but then the customer needs to collect them and do all that stuff, right?\n0:35:48 – 0:35:57\n\nAnd there is a lot of back and forth between the three of us, right?\n0:35:57 – 0:36:02\n\nGenAI, whatever you want to do, and then transform the data to what my system understands, right?\n0:36:03 – 0:36:22\n\nIn an ATM job, input-output is defined, right?\n0:36:22 – 0:36:25\n\nCorrect.\n0:36:25 – 0:36:27\n\nInput-output, formats are defined, right? Here, the problem is output format is defined, input format is not defined.\n0:36:28 – 0:36:35\n\nThe customer and data depend on that, right?\n0:36:35 – 0:36:38\n\nSo, any formatted data should be cleaned and mapped in that form, just like my system understands.\n0:36:38 – 0:36:47\n\nI think that will help me speed up my customer adoption, sir.\n0:36:47 – 0:36:54\n\nSo, if I don't have enough data for the customer to retain, then using the product is a no-brainer for them.\n0:36:55 – 0:37:06\n\nThe effort of adopting is way too high and I lose a few customers, especially the smaller ones, who say that they are not getting anything from us.\n0:37:06 – 0:37:16\n\nSo, the main problem is getting on the bandwagon. Once the climb is on the car, it will go on.\n0:37:16 – 0:37:21\n\nThe climb is the main problem. Where will it go?\n0:37:21 – 0:37:24\n\nThat makes sense.\n0:37:24 – 0:37:25\n\nThat makes sense.\n0:37:25 – 0:37:27\n\nThat makes a lot of sense.\n0:37:27 – 0:37:30\n\nAnd my last set of questions, this is just hindsight questions based on what, and this is your opinion?\n0:37:30 – 0:37:36\n\nHindsight, yes.\n0:37:36 – 0:37:38\n\nSo, one is like, what do you think is the hardest hurdle you faced in implementing or still are facing in implementing JNI solutions?\n0:37:38 – 0:37:45\n\nOne of them would be like, they are not reliable, they are not up to the mark, or whatever your hindsides are.\n0:37:45 – 0:37:52\n\nSo far that you have done so many different usages already.\n0:37:53 – 0:37:56\n\nIt's evolving to fast, which is good and not bad.\n0:37:56 – 0:38:05\n\nSo, it's like, you know, the fact that we keep on dating about technology and all that, right?\n0:38:05 – 0:38:13\n\nBut there's so much you understand that it becomes overwhelming, right?\n0:38:13 – 0:38:17\n\nA year ago, when the Chandi PD 3 released, the 3 or 3.5, whatever that was, right?\n0:38:18 – 0:38:23\n\nI thought we should make support magic lights.\n0:38:23 – 0:38:28\n\nWhich is a support request.\n0:38:28 – 0:38:31\n\nAfter 2-3 months, they released it as a feature.\n0:38:31 – 0:38:35\n\nCorrect.\n0:38:35 – 0:38:37\n\nRight?\n0:38:37 – 0:38:39\n\nSo, building on anything on top of it becomes tough.\n0:38:39 – 0:38:47\n\nBecause it's moving so fast.\n0:38:47 – 0:38:49\n\nIt's not a trusted platform.\n0:38:49 – 0:38:52\n\nBasically, you don't know whether you should wait and watch or you should build.\n0:38:52 – 0:38:57\n\nThat's the core that you're putting up.\n0:38:57 – 0:38:59\n\nMaybe if you put, let's say, 6 months in building, maybe 4 months down the line, it just comes up automatically.\n0:38:59 – 0:39:05\n\nExactly. And it's much easier for them to do that, versus us to do that.\n0:39:05 – 0:39:12\n\nAnd as a start-up, I mean, I cannot invest 100 people and build something on top of it.\n0:39:13 – 0:39:18\n\nRight?\n0:39:18 – 0:39:20\n\nI make a small model of one or two people per night.\n0:39:20 – 0:39:23\n\nThis customer-share thingy is a good example.\n0:39:23 – 0:39:27\n\nRight?\n0:39:27 – 0:39:29\n\nRight now, they're launching a feature.\n0:39:29 – 0:39:32\n\nChandi PD, I was Sam all the time.\n0:39:32 – 0:39:35\n\nThey say, upload an AP image.\n0:39:35 – 0:39:38\n\nAbout that, I identify all the objects.\n0:39:39 – 0:39:43\n\nTell me the count.\n0:39:43 – 0:39:45\n\nI'll study it.\n0:39:45 – 0:39:47\n\nRight.\n0:39:47 – 0:39:49\n\nThat's the thing.\n0:39:49 – 0:39:51\n\nThat is the product officer, right?\n0:39:51 – 0:39:54\n\nThat's it.\n0:39:54 – 0:39:56\n\nThere's so much happening.\n0:39:56 – 0:39:58\n\nWhere do I put my product?\n0:39:58 – 0:40:00\n\nSo, the biggest certainty is it's evolving too fast and it's not known when to enter and when not to enter.\n0:40:00 – 0:40:06\n\nYeah.\n0:40:06 – 0:40:08\n\nSo, next would be, what is your most notable success and if you can measure a benefit, the benefit.\n0:40:08 – 0:40:15\n\nSo, from what we already discussed, you said the biggest success is generally in your case, marketing.\n0:40:15 – 0:40:21\n\nBecause you've been able to churn out content around 20% faster, right?\n0:40:21 – 0:40:25\n\nYes.\n0:40:25 – 0:40:27\n\nI would classify that as development. As a developer, we are finding 10% faster. The reason is marketing is still sucked.\n0:40:28 – 0:40:40\n\nIt's not that we are getting a lot of leads, the business value is more.\n0:40:40 – 0:40:48\n\nSo, roughly 10% faster in development, which is like saving you money and time.\n0:40:48 – 0:40:54\n\nYeah.\n0:40:54 – 0:40:56\n\nIn other words, I can work on things faster rather than saving on money and time.\n0:40:57 – 0:41:04\n\nFaster delivery.\n0:41:04 – 0:41:06\n\nYeah.\n0:41:06 – 0:41:08\n\nPerfect. So, that clarifies.\n0:41:08 – 0:41:11\n\nAwesome.\n0:41:11 – 0:41:14\n\nOkay. And with all this that you've gone through, right?\n0:41:14 – 0:41:18\n\nI mean, everything that you've gone through, what is your biggest elevation on learning?\n0:41:18 – 0:41:22\n\nWhat have you been able to, like, aha moment yet?\n0:41:23 – 0:41:27\n\nThis thing seems like today or tomorrow, tomorrow or after 10 years, this is something which is like an aha thing that can be done.\n0:41:27 – 0:41:34\n\nOr, I mean, this will make a difference.\n0:41:34 – 0:41:38\n\nAny such revelation that you got on learning while implementing GenAI as you were already using so much of it?\n0:41:38 – 0:41:44\n\nAs I said, I, whether you speak a revolution or whatever, I have so much trust in GenAI right now.\n0:41:50 – 0:41:59\n\nIt will change everything, right?\n0:41:59 – 0:42:02\n\nIt's, to me, it's the next big wave.\n0:42:02 – 0:42:05\n\nLike, from the mainframe, you went to the desktop.\n0:42:05 – 0:42:09\n\nFrom the desktop to the cloud, from the desktop to the mobile, right?\n0:42:09 – 0:42:13\n\nFrom the mobile to the desktop, you bandwagon it, right?\n0:42:13 – 0:42:16\n\nThis is much, much better than even that.\n0:42:16 – 0:42:19\n\nBecause, effectively, it's that someone who's super smart, super intelligent, right?\n0:42:19 – 0:42:26\n\nHe'll just be going towards the AGI with that person.\n0:42:26 – 0:42:30\n\nYou'll just need to know how to communicate with that person, right?\n0:42:30 – 0:42:35\n\nAnd place the orders.\n0:42:35 – 0:42:37\n\nAnd soon, it will evolve into features where it will tell you how to communicate with that person, right?\n0:42:37 – 0:42:44\n\nSo, right now, prompt engineering, right? Prompt engineers have paid so much.\n0:42:45 – 0:42:50\n\nBy the way, the prompt engineering is over.\n0:42:50 – 0:42:53\n\nIt's already evolving.\n0:42:53 – 0:42:56\n\nOpenAI has started removing it.\n0:42:56 – 0:42:59\n\nCloud has removed it that you have to make a prompt.\n0:42:59 – 0:43:01\n\nTake this, make it with this.\n0:43:01 – 0:43:03\n\nYes, exactly.\n0:43:03 – 0:43:05\n\nSo, that's the thing.\n0:43:05 – 0:43:07\n\nAnd that is, that was the thing.\n0:43:07 – 0:43:09\n\nThat's right.\n0:43:09 – 0:43:11\n\nAnd after two months, they removed it.\n0:43:11 – 0:43:13\n\nSo, you think that this is the next biggest wave and it will soon evolve.\n0:43:14 – 0:43:20\n\nAnd it will change a lot of things.\n0:43:20 – 0:43:22\n\nBut what in specific do you think would it make a big change in?\n0:43:22 – 0:43:28\n\nAnd then, will it change the way we are doing business?\n0:43:28 – 0:43:32\n\nWill it change the way we are doing development?\n0:43:32 – 0:43:34\n\nWill it change the way we are, like, as an organization altogether?\n0:43:34 – 0:43:39\n\nWhat's your aim that, yes, it's going to change?\n0:43:40 – 0:43:45\n\nIt's okay if we want tech team or...\n0:43:45 – 0:43:51\n\nIn general.\n0:43:51 – 0:43:53\n\n...back in the world.\n0:43:53 – 0:43:55\n\nSo, I think it will happen.\n0:43:55 – 0:43:58\n\n100% of the jobs, okay?\n0:43:58 – 0:44:03\n\n80-90% will just simply evolve.\n0:44:03 – 0:44:06\n\nRight?\n0:44:06 – 0:44:08\n\nThat doesn't mean the new types won't evolve.\n0:44:09 – 0:44:12\n\nOf course.\n0:44:12 – 0:44:14\n\nBut the jobs that we know now...\n0:44:14 – 0:44:17\n\n...the changes that have taken place in the last 100 years...\n0:44:17 – 0:44:22\n\n...they will take place in the next 10 years.\n0:44:22 – 0:44:25\n\nI agree with you.\n0:44:25 – 0:44:27\n\nThe changes that have taken place in the job will take place in the next 10 years.\n0:44:27 – 0:44:30\n\nRight?\n0:44:30 – 0:44:32\n\nHow the layer works.\n0:44:32 – 0:44:34\n\nHow the doctor works.\n0:44:34 – 0:44:36\n\nHow the PM works.\n0:44:36 – 0:44:38\n\nI agree with you.\n0:44:38 – 0:44:39\n\nEspecially in the blue-collared jobs.\n0:44:39 – 0:44:42\n\nKnowledge workers.\n0:44:42 – 0:44:44\n\nThat will completely change.\n0:44:44 – 0:44:47\n\nIt will be a lot more efficient.\n0:44:47 – 0:44:49\n\nAnd in your organization, let's say...\n0:44:49 – 0:44:52\n\n...what do you think, like, you thought about the world...\n0:44:52 – 0:44:55\n\n...what do you think in an organization like yours...\n0:44:55 – 0:44:58\n\n...what is the big elevation learning that will change altogether?\n0:44:58 – 0:45:01\n\nWhat will it do?\n0:45:01 – 0:45:03\n\nIt aligns very well.\n0:45:03 – 0:45:07\n\nMy vision is to make the product simple and easy to use.\n0:45:07 – 0:45:10\n\nI would perform quotient using JNI...\n0:45:10 – 0:45:15\n\n...to make the product easy to use and so on.\n0:45:15 – 0:45:18\n\nOkay.\n0:45:18 – 0:45:20\n\nThis is a rudimentary question so you can choose not to answer it.\n0:45:20 – 0:45:23\n\nBut if you have a chance to turn back any year and have LLM...\n0:45:23 – 0:45:27\n\n...as a strong force coming to you at that point of time...\n0:45:27 – 0:45:30\n\n...right? A year ago.\n0:45:30 – 0:45:32\n\nThat this thing has come and it will happen like this.\n0:45:32 – 0:45:34\n\nRight? It will reach this stage.\n0:45:34 – 0:45:36\n\nWhat do you think would you have done differently...\n0:45:36 – 0:45:38\n\n...coming up to now?\n0:45:38 – 0:45:41\n\nOr nothing different is a good way itself?\n0:45:41 – 0:45:43\n\nI would have been more into my project as such.\n0:45:43 – 0:45:48\n\nRight? So...\n0:45:48 – 0:45:50\n\n...maybe I would have taken that step or not, I don't know.\n0:45:50 – 0:45:55\n\nBut as we say, right?\n0:45:55 – 0:45:57\n\nWe have the product.\n0:45:57 – 0:45:59\n\nIn design thinking, we have the API first.\n0:45:59 – 0:46:02\n\nWe should have developed the APIs first without worrying about the UI.\n0:46:03 – 0:46:06\n\nThat's right.\n0:46:06 – 0:46:08\n\nRight?\n0:46:08 – 0:46:10\n\nMaybe I would have been like LLM first product, right?\n0:46:10 – 0:46:15\n\nWhere the way you design a product...\n0:46:15 – 0:46:18\n\n...conventionally using those screens, designing and voting...\n0:46:18 – 0:46:22\n\n...that's where I think how would a user be able to easily interact.\n0:46:22 – 0:46:28\n\nAnd it's a very different philosophy.\n0:46:30 – 0:46:33\n\nProbably it's something I wouldn't have done...\n0:46:33 – 0:46:35\n\n...but I would have started something at the end.\n0:46:35 – 0:46:38\n\nRight?\n0:46:38 – 0:46:40\n\nIt's like how can you look at an existing product and see...\n0:46:40 – 0:46:43\n\n...if LLM would have been the first product...\n0:46:43 – 0:46:46\n\n...how would have you built that infrastructure?\n0:46:46 – 0:46:49\n\nI totally agree with you 100%.\n0:46:49 – 0:46:51\n\nTotally agree with you on that.\n0:46:51 – 0:46:53\n\nAnd second last question...\n0:46:53 – 0:46:55\n\n...do you have an opinion on JNI being super helpful...\n0:46:55 – 0:46:58\n\n...not helpful, marginally helpful in your business as of today?\n0:46:59 – 0:47:02\n\nRight? And what drives your opinion as of today?\n0:47:02 – 0:47:05\n\nAs of today, it's super helpful.\n0:47:05 – 0:47:09\n\nIt impacts my developers.\n0:47:09 – 0:47:12\n\nIt impacts my marketing.\n0:47:12 – 0:47:15\n\nPlus, it gives me confidence that...\n0:47:15 – 0:47:19\n\n...if my support needs increased tenets, right?\n0:47:19 – 0:47:23\n\nI won't have to hire ten tenets people.\n0:47:23 – 0:47:27\n\nIt also helps you scale.\n0:47:28 – 0:47:29\n\nYeah.\n0:47:29 – 0:47:31\n\nIt will help me scale.\n0:47:31 – 0:47:34\n\nIt gives me that confidence.\n0:47:34 – 0:47:36\n\nGetting that confidence is the main thing...\n0:47:36 – 0:47:38\n\n...because now at least you are not scared that...\n0:47:38 – 0:47:40\n\n...what will I do if ten more people come?\n0:47:40 – 0:47:42\n\nOr how will I hire more people?\n0:47:42 – 0:47:44\n\nYou know that you have somewhere to go at least.\n0:47:44 – 0:47:46\n\nRight? And the last question is...\n0:47:46 – 0:47:48\n\nSorry?\n0:47:48 – 0:47:50\n\nCan you scale?\n0:47:50 – 0:47:52\n\nIt's a big word.\n0:47:52 – 0:47:54\n\nI wasn't used to scale. But yes, now I know it's much more...\n0:47:55 – 0:47:59\n\n...tangible that way.\n0:47:59 – 0:48:01\n\nIt's a little less.\n0:48:01 – 0:48:04\n\nOkay. So basically the risk was reduced during the time of scale.\n0:48:04 – 0:48:08\n\nAnd what is your recommendation for a company looking at...\n0:48:08 – 0:48:13\n\n...digital transformation through AI?\n0:48:13 – 0:48:15\n\nWhat is your recommendation?\n0:48:15 – 0:48:17\n\nLet's say a person is either running an existing company...\n0:48:17 – 0:48:20\n\n...or launching a company.\n0:48:20 – 0:48:22\n\nWhat do you think would be your advice or recommendation?\n0:48:22 – 0:48:24\n\nIn terms of them transferring their company's regenerative error.\n0:48:24 – 0:48:28\n\nYeah.\n0:48:28 – 0:48:30\n\nSame thing.\n0:48:30 – 0:48:32\n\nLLM first.\n0:48:32 – 0:48:34\n\nLet's do a redo today.\n0:48:34 – 0:48:36\n\nSo what was the product?\n0:48:36 – 0:48:39\n\nRight?\n0:48:39 – 0:48:41\n\nThe existing product.\n0:48:41 – 0:48:43\n\nAnd through LLM, what are the functionalities...\n0:48:43 – 0:48:46\n\n...rather than 24 by 1 and all that.\n0:48:46 – 0:48:48\n\nRight?\n0:48:48 – 0:48:50\n\nYou can significantly enhance your product...\n0:48:50 – 0:48:52\n\n...by integrating more and more of LLM.\n0:48:53 – 0:48:56\n\nThank you. I think I got all my answers.\n0:48:56 – 0:49:01\n\nAnd two things really stuck to my head.\n0:49:01 – 0:49:04\n\nAnd those two things I would love to share as much as I can.\n0:49:04 – 0:49:07\n\nNumber one was...\n0:49:07 – 0:49:10\n\nI want my product to not be there. There should be no product.\n0:49:10 – 0:49:13\n\nMy product should be no product. Right?\n0:49:13 – 0:49:15\n\nThat is a very good thought in terms...\n0:49:15 – 0:49:18\n\n...the whole interface is going to change.\n0:49:18 – 0:49:20\n\nIf we actually interact with products and use them...\n0:49:21 – 0:49:23\n\n...it is going to change. I totally agree with that.\n0:49:23 – 0:49:25\n\nThat sticks to me.\n0:49:25 – 0:49:27\n\nAnd the last one is...\n0:49:27 – 0:49:29\n\n...think LLM first.\n0:49:29 – 0:49:31\n\nThink API first products or what.\n0:49:31 – 0:49:34\n\nThink LLM first.\n0:49:34 – 0:49:36\n\nThese are two things that stick to my head.\n0:49:36 – 0:49:38\n\nVery well put up.\n0:49:38 – 0:49:40\n\nBoth of them.\n0:49:40 – 0:49:42\n\nThank you, sir.\n0:49:42 – 0:49:44\n\nI am turning off the recording.\n0:49:44 – 0:49:46\n\nI'm not as ready as I had to run.\n0:49:46 – 0:49:48\n\n\n\n\nToo much hype but in reality how much of it is delivering, how much is blocked and why and how much will not benefit\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming Sales and Distribution Businesses with the ‘Magic of Technology’ - Empowering Last-Mile Sales & Distribution - Cloud-based last mile B2B sales & distribution platform for distributors and wholesalers for greater operational visibility and better business control\n\nManual Entries - Misc Translations\nInterfaces - User / Support\n\nPRQ\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nTech solution/प्रोडक्ट (cloudbased - B2B) for Sales & Distribution and the niche being Last mile delivery - Software - FMCG F&B\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\nEmp - 25\n$1M\nAI Adoption Level: Has the company starting adopting AI technologies and where are we so far?\nSMB - Pen Paper -> 95% solved by delivery - then SLA\n\n\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nRoute Optimization\nOrder Allocation\nGenAi\nWholesalers / Manufactures -> retailers -> many prods - not digitized\nPhotos - identify and digitize shelf\nReasons not implemented\n4/5 man weeks - competition - level 3\nNon more investment - but confidence they have a base\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals which seems like they can benefit from AI?\nERP - Simplify UI - Voice/Tasks/ - Adoption Rate/Reluctance to change\nAnalytics - top 5 / queries - hybrid - skilled manpower reduction / Save time\nGemeni 1.5 Pro - Insights (uploading customer data) - as it matures Extraction/Classification - scale - add ons \nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI and how you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nGithub Co-pilot\nCanva\nChat GPT\nWriteSonic\nImage / Content / Code / Meeting Recording\n\n\nFuture Plans: What are the company's plans which can be affected by AI or generative AI if done right?\nTIQ - Gen AI will change stuff\nTechnology Infrastructure\n\n\nPeople\nPush People - use not paying / tracking\n \nCulture\nPush to Use Dev/Marketting\nDev/Marketting - 20/30% productivity - \nConcrete\nLearn and Train\nSlaes / customer supp\nHardly using\nPilot - Chat to support\nProcesses\nMark/Dev Process\n\n\nOperations\nMarketting - 15/20% \nDev 5/10%\nData\nDon’t Care\nAspiration\nProduct easier to use and Adopt\nInterface - ETL without defined\n“Best Product is no Products”\nHSQ\nWhat, in hindsight was your hardest hurdle or still is in implementing GenAI solutions?\nEvolving too fast \nEasier for them than us\n\n\nWhat overall is your most notable success while implementing the GenAI solution, and how did you measure the impact?\nMarketing - churn out content 20%\nDev - ~10% fastewr delivery\nWhat was your biggest revelation/learning while implementing GenAI in your organization?\nNext big wave - soon will evolve\nJओबीएस (८०/९०% विल गो) blue collared\n\n\nWhat if you had a chance to turn back a year, what would you do differently?\nAPI first product - LLM first prod - Interact\nDo you have an opinion on Gen AI being super helpful/not helpful or only marginally helpful for your business?

I'm play a little piece.\n\n@0:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm going to play a piece. I'm going to play a little piece. This gives me once again,over.\n\n@1:43 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\n?\n\n@1:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\n? ? ?\n\n@1:51 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\n? ?\n\n@1:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\n?\n\n@1:57 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYeah.\n\n@1:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's good. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n@2:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nAwesome.\n\n@2:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I see a lot of good work being done and I went to the site and I think really looks great.\nOkay.\n\n@2:09 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nThank you so much.\n\n@2:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow is the ground work? mean, how far have we reached in terms of, I mean, we are only focusing on Rajasthan for now, but I'm bad.\nNo, I mean, theoretically in the website we have list errors.\n\n@2:23 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nare creating a website. So in Rajasthan, we are all over Rajasthan. And we are all so stuck. We completed a pilot in Karnataka.\n\n@2:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd I wish you an official announcement to arrive to scale Karnataka.\n\n@2:38 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nAnd in Maharashtra, we are piloting for a couple of districts. And yeah, that's our footprints right now.\n\n@2:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great. If I can connect you to some people in Maharashtra and all, let me know I would love to.\n\n@2:54 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay, definitely. Yeah.\n\n@2:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. Some of these people I really need to move forward.\n\n@2:59 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nlove them.\n\n@3:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyou are doing great job there. So, what industry is going to be on this?\n\n@3:07 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIt's a public health organization. Okay, I need an option.\n\n@3:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIs it like a non-profit sector or what sector is it for this? It's a Ng, NgU and NpU, basically, not for the profit.\n\n@3:32 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nWe, with the solutions, we give it and we have cost all the services, so we have cost two in the government.\nSo, that's how it operates.\n\n@3:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's awesome. And what would be the rough size in terms of turnover or in terms of number of people that we have together right now?\n\n@3:58 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nRight now, we have 95 plus\n\n@4:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm sorry, really fine. 95 percent. So 95 people, mean, turnover number that I can have, probably that's okay with you.\n\n@4:17 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nWell, not from financial team, but I'm not aware of that, but I can come back with that. We have an annual report, so probably it's in the website itself, annual report.\n\n@4:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. This is for categorization, nothing else, basically. Yeah, yeah, understood. Thank you. Okay. So, it's okay. It's okay. Okay.\nThat's okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, All right.\n\n@5:26 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nright. So, week we will take one corner.\n\n@5:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou My apologies are you going to get that number?\n\n@6:05 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYes, yes, I am. Financial year 2021.\n\n@6:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's an $983K dollar and expenditure.\n\n@6:17 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay. It's FY 2021. That's good. And the expenditure is expenditure 862. too bad.\n\n@6:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's why I am in the end. Turnover is good enough. Just to categorization in terms of size, how the product is good, right?\nAnd this is different sectors. this is really, really great. So in terms of gen AI adoption, we had optionality, a lot of scope that you have in the kind of market that you have.\nAnd how is it going there? Gen AI adoption, yes. It is pretty faster, even in healthcare system.\n\n@6:53 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo especially, we are also working on some part of it.\n\n@6:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFor example,\n\n@7:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nWe and Microsoft Research, we are working to build a LLM that will help the frontline health workers on learning of language which kind of LMS is now.\nSo where we upload the knowledge base based on that health workers can ask questionaries and get up-to-date information from the knowledge of it's a what's up connected bot so that's one of the things we have implemented it's a file-based right now.\n\n@7:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd how are you putting Godrays? I'm very interested in that specifically concerning this is health right and people are on the ground and they might need immediate assistance and I know the amount of like Godrays required to get that done that in education right so there must be very challenging right now right?\n\n@7:53 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nWell my contribution over there is bit less because tech support from Microsoft The search has contributed a lot on this, so there is a open-source LLM button, it's been hosted on Azure and it's connected using the translation service, that's how it's being operated.\n\n@8:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGod rise, on the point of God rise, I believe, I don't think they have played much specifically because health workers, so we did phase one instance, like people are sometimes asking questions, apart from the knowledge base, which is supposed to reply.\n\n@8:41 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo that's been here, God ran implementers, just to focus only on the knowledge base pattern, particularly in two health care domain, apart from out of the context of their asking questions, it should be explained, I don't know something like that.\n\n@8:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great. That's one side of God, we might be going outside the defined area, right? The other kind of garden is also that I asked for the heart condition and it hallucinated and gave me .\nYeah, so hallucination is still a problem that we are facing because people speak in Hindi.\n\n@9:15 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo we directly call it in like Rajasthan. So people speak in Hindi, sometimes people say anime and they recognize that it's an unknown.\n\n@9:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd voice recognition.\n\n@9:30 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, Rajasthan is to create a certain number of problems.\n\n@9:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI still came having found way to tackle that. Oh, that's not easy to tell me personally. But yeah, I mean with the kind of things which are happening, if you need my assistance or something, then I can probably come with it and I'm here.\nRight? In terms of TI adoption, other than the LLM chart board, which is a watch of facing, is there anything else that we are using in terms of any AI organization?\n\n@10:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYeah, I mean, we are also trying to build a board that can, well, board that can recognize the data schema and understand it, build down the questionnaires, pull out the stats, show is in visualization metrics and summarize it.\nSo that's that is going to help our government officials, so because the government officials mostly use mobiles rarely use their desktop and we have the dashboard, they have less utilization of the desktop dashboards.\nSo though the dashboard is mobile compatible, but people love to use some application, native applications. If we somehow are able to integrate in WhatsApp and people, let's say asking, what is the total and make a case in J4, and the bot can able to connect with our system and follow of the cumulative aggregated value that there are 1.\ndynamic cases in Jaipur specifically pointing in this locality. So, something summarization around that context, I mean like we started building it, we are just exploring on that concept.\nYour voice is gone, I can't wait to hear it. I say that's that's great thought, but that will require a lot of hospital integration and integrating into their system etc right.\nSo, we build the health system and we officially legally work have access to the address systems of all health indicators, public health indicators specifically.\nSo, we want that systems to run on top of that data. Also, we kind of do.\n\n@11:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust a single pane of glass kind of environment right.\n\n@12:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYes, a single environment where all that data will be pouring into and we have to go only the necessary thing, something like that.\nSo on that case the bot will have access to all necessary things.\n\n@12:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great.\n\n@12:14 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nThat's awesome.\n\n@12:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in terms of like things like marketing or reaching out to people or let's say mailers or post things are you using JNI or are you like it's more of a manual task for now?\n\n@12:30 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nNo, like I think three, what we do our team is having tech, doctors, health managers and some epidemiologists and many people that are saying something like that.\nSo we built a product, we showcased it on to the government, the government approved it to scale. So there is no such marketing of the product.\nbecause we are not selling anything right so we are just asking them to adoption as it is one of the top technologies so government that are today and we are scaling like moreover planning is the biggest part to the health worker keeping them up to date giving them training up new future launches in the application that is the biggest part so we have sound decay, ashha, it's all across so in order to clean them that is surely the source involved on that so in state level we have to prepare master's like this and they will go to their block level and district level so in that's about it it's a change process so we haven't built the system but in the future we are thinking to we have the training document basically so if that training the manual useful manual\napplications can be processed and it helps the healthcare on life to navigate on the application itself to train some specific module, so something like this.\nSo that really, you know, anytime without any assistance of any human being, they can empower themselves on using that digital system.\nlot of Pasha and M doesn't know even how to access future products.\n\n@14:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's a profit use case. So, training and evaluation, basically both of them integrated together, right? Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. That's a great use case for it.\nSo now, specifically talking, so if I talk about today, right, I mean, I got two essential prospects from you in terms of recognizing and summarizing health capacities on top of the data that you have.\nThe second one I understood was clearing an evaluation, where we can do a lot better using JNI. But if I look at the current situation of AI adoption for a specific AI project that you are currently working on, or you have tried and failed.\nheld or tried and it didn't do well either way I only heard about one and that was a chatbot for front-end health workers right yes yes okay great now this is a very specific and very different kind of organization so my question will be a bit modified with regards to that now in terms of strategic rules of the organization right I understand that day one thing is we need to build on top of the health care data that we have so that people can query it basically an easy variable system right and the second is we want to clean and evaluate people so that we can get the right element of let's say technology and right level of knowledge at the right place right other than that is there any other strategic rule that you have in mind so I forgot to mention one very important thing\nBecause they are using mobile devices, that's fine, they are handling a very less number of people on the ground.\n\n@16:06 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nParticularly, the medical officer who is a doctor in nature, he is supposed to handle 2,200 cases.\n\n@16:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPrimary health center, there are community health center, government center.\n\n@16:16 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, he barely spares 3 to 5 minutes through a patient.\n\n@16:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, which is the system that is probably going to increase because we have to enter the data in this application.\n\n@16:28 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nI mean, now all the public guys system.\n\n@16:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI must go to the hospital. The other one I understood was that doctors get 3 to 5 minutes per patient and they look at 100-100 cases per month, is it?\n\n@16:45 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nNo, per day.\n\n@16:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so what I will see here?\n\n@16:50 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, implementing a model where it will convert the Now, voice based content to electronic health record, okay, it will map.\nSo let's say. Yes, some kind of like that.\n\n@17:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd pull the particular word and map it with the health indicators. Makes sense. So basically you need some kind of a transcription system that creates the record and can maintain it so that Dr.\ncan save time on this other way. Yeah, so it will pre-fill the application indicators.\n\n@17:30 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nyou don't need to fill the indicators. That's why the context will complete the interflow and your passion is already registered.\nSo it's easy. That sounds great.\n\n@17:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat sounds really awesome. So these are some of strategy goals. Anything else that I'm missing?\n\n@17:47 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nNo, so specifically here, reducing the data entry points are a method to simplify the workflow of data entry for the health workers.\nThat's a very important goal. Okay, like ground learning facts, so we have to train the health workers with less utilization of resource.\nAnd the thing is knowledge base for the health workers, they can learn anytime, come back, ask questionaries, find whatever they want.\nAnd fourth other side, helping the health workers to have their metrics on and to do the surveillance activities, know, resource mobilization, etc.\n\n@18:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAre you also maintaining the KPI's or KRA's in terms of what they have done and what not, and I mean, is there a system in terms of managing that as well?\nYes, that is what I said, right?\n\n@18:43 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, LLLA board that will help them to find the key performance indicators, summarize the data, whatever the question they ask, it'll summarize based on that.\nSo, whatever data we have, it's almost a 4 to 5C data, and rather specifically, to those\n\n@19:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nor summarize that in a single dashboard all the manufacturers are accessing all the KPS are built out of that.\nWhat are you trying to ask for? Is this something that we are doing or we intend to? No, it is something we are doing.\nSo, we have a separate WhatsApp channel that does this and then calculates the data. Oh, okay, the particular A model is something we are building right now.\nknow, across the IDS stage, we are doing the development particularly.\n\n@19:32 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nBut the dashboard and the KPS, those are going to present and the LLM thing, we are building it, making the IK2C perfect.\nACTION ITEM: Build an AI model to automate KPI tracking and data summarization, improving the current manual process - WATCH\nyeah.\n\n@19:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, right now the KPI and all that basically managed to the database and just a dash booting that we have done, right?\n\n@19:46 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYeah, data engineering team and the developers are handling it manually.\n\n@19:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat sounds great. Now, in terms of, I mean, understanding things, we are going to break down, okay?\n\n@20:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nI'm going to break down in terms of technology and infrastructure from what I assume you are funded by Microsoft so there will be some amount of Azure resources that you would be using and stuff there right so I mean is there some amount of so there they showed me the JNI adaptation in the CAC pipeline if integrations application performance monitoring etc etc but unfortunately first we are an NGO and second all the actual things are posted in government on premise there are centers it's not cloud so you can't be able to leverage a lot of the advanced services directly whatever we built\nis made up of open source. So that is why I said we are building. So like, or else we might have adopted some existing technologies or JNI concepts easily.\nSo we build, and it is entirely free of course. They are model which we are building right now for the health workers on the WhatsApp.\n\n@21:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nfree of course. One day the government has to pay the WhatsApp business API charges.\n\n@21:21 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo something like that. So yeah.\n\n@21:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo is this government data center kind of a physical data center that you go and put the bare metal end or is this Microsoft supported data center that the government pays off over.\nNo, no. It's a government like physical data center bare metal VM, sorry, given all top of that. Azure is something which you are pilot in pilot phase.\nOkay.\n\n@21:46 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nyeah.\n\n@21:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo all of our development, you know, development, testing, staging, all happens on AWS for different services.\n\n@21:55 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nBut the production, the data, we are going to scale. It's going to happen on performance. Let us understand.\n\n@22:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThen we don't secure the company else and show.\n\n@22:04 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nThis is awesome.\n\n@22:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI might probably get in touch with you to understand this more for an education in here that I'm planning.\nSo maybe I need to include you separately for that part of this conversation. So this is one part technology and infrastructure, right?\nWhat about coding? Are your coders directly under you and they are working? Or are they just open-source people contributing to open-source projects or how is it working?\nOkay, so we have in-house tech thing. Kind of one of the NGO in India. Having in-house tech people, almost 15 20 plus tech members.\nThat's how it works. Android, back-end, full-stack, design, UI works.\n\n@22:48 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nData science and data engineering.\n\n@22:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAwesome. Yeah, so we have all the things. Everything happens in-house, full-time employees. Yeah. And are these people using Gennai in their day-to-day work?\nObviously, static predict for our best friend. But I mean, these developers, think it's Microsoft is with you. It's a great way of getting ahead and going for things like GitHub Propilot, which basically does a lot of things done in terms of development and also, are you leveraging those things or not yet?\n\n@23:29 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay, so even Microsoft Research is not the owner of CoPilot.\n\n@23:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's a big of Microsoft. So they do have a strict form and limited resource access. So what they can do or they cannot do.\n\n@23:44 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay, so Microsoft Research is only helping us in building a technical technology concept and doing a research with us.\nThat's it.\n\n@23:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo they cannot really afford to give any other services.\n\n@23:57 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nEven though a Zoom is made by us. So, that's how it goes. Okay.\n\n@24:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAll right. So then in that case, I think there are three things that you, your team can use. I can probably suggest that being faster.ai, if you try it out, it's the developers become faster.\nThat's so R.ai. Okay. should try those out. It will help your developers be able to faster this, suggest it to them, see if it helps them out.\nACTION ITEM: Try out faster.ai and Copilot to improve developer productivity - WATCH\nYeah.\n\n@24:27 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nDefinitely.\n\n@24:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight? Okay. Moving on in terms of, let us say, culture, right? From what I understand, on what you have said so far, I understand that you are promoting a culture.\nGo ahead. Get JNI, right? Use it as much as you can to save time. But are there any, anything in that culture that you are seeing here, I mean, do not and waste your time spending time.\nright, time and money works. So, is the, what is the general AI side of the culture that you are promoting in this other day?\n\n@25:08 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay.\n\n@25:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, first we are working with very sensitive data that's held and it's not about our entire iteration about that.\n\n@25:16 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIt is that's data.\n\n@25:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely.\n\n@25:18 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nwe have this that you should not put down to any data directly into the So, again, I always insist my developer do not copy paste whatever code you generated into your system.\n\n@25:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay.\n\n@25:39 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYou ask the question, it gives you entertainment code. Maybe it runs perfectly.\n\n@25:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut what is lagging the code? Is it appropriate?\n\n@25:47 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nyou able to understand the codes concepts or not? So, obviously, at the end of the day, the developer can be able to understand the code on the next day when something else new comes in.\n\n@25:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhether the same whole system can.\n\n@26:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nable to handle or you want to different in new class or not. So, without understanding, it's useless.\n\n@26:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's right. Yeah.\n\n@26:09 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nAnd I like, I mean, usually when you're writing any content, please go through the content carefully once, before basically you're not always saying you used to write a lot of contents.\n\n@26:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, make guidelines for first protocols, or the compelling message or writing emails. So, it's always very much consistent to go through the content only, making sure the contents are clear.\n\n@26:37 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, these kind of events are normally given.\n\n@26:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, but this is the generic culture that you have developed. And this culture can really prevail as the processes that you put in place, that people don't go left or right and they actually maintain those guidelines that you have given.\nIs there any process that you put in place as good? No such process has been put into it, so we have subscribed to Chatsubiti 4 with the teams where first of all policy level it's been approved by Chatsubiti that they are not going to use those data for training purposes.\nIt's like, I mean, just usually at least comes to a mostly jump into the code review and I figured out that I am pretty well able to find this in general from A or cumulative code.\n\n@27:37 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIt's very easy to figure it out. So I usually ask the other facts, like do you understand the code, what is the concept behind it?\nSo, mean, it's a culture, know, culture cannot be forced, right? So it has to be grown inside. So, a constant effort has to be given from the world.\n\n@28:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthe organizations side to uh cultivate it we can ask for it we have a basic culture in place but we are not putting processes to uh streamline uh things across from those maybe like uh i can take your suggestions on double that if you have certain kind of principles to enforce this procedure we can get it separately and we can talk about those yeah moving on in terms further so operations is not a part of thing right you have operations where you have people going and there's so much data being collected and so much happening all around how do you manage that and is there any gen AI that you're using in managing operation of us no no there is no gen AI being implemented to manage the operations those are normal human based works so how about people like internal people or external people you said there's a chat what that basically helps them out but is there something that internally helps the people that you work around with\nYou are an internal team, HR basis or whatever, mean, it's general, you're helping out in something more in terms of internal usage within the company.\nSo, again, like the thing is most of our fundraising here are the officials, like top managers who are having a meeting with our US officers.\n\n@29:27 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nThey need quick stats.\n\n@29:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, in front of officials, they come with certain preparation based on the meeting.\n\n@29:36 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nBut sometimes, unexpended questionnaire is sponsored, right?\n\n@29:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, what about this coverage of the population?\n\n@29:46 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nmuch have we had a lot of chances of this forecast?\n\n@29:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, any questions?\n\n@29:54 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nAs I said earlier, I can answer the question. Connecting. to the staff database, this is not going to only official help workers and the official partner to the team to make better guidance at the point of time during the meeting or even in the writing here, what do I say, fundraising the accommodations or proposals, unit certain metrics to justify that, right?\nSo, they can use this tool to fastily pull out the metrics instead of manually going through the data engineering team, find if they are available, have to connect, like go to the data center, figure out the data sets, calculate, so instead of that, so this, you know, chatbot can help in one or the other way through the internal team operation.\nBut other than that, human management, anything else, we are not using J&A much of, right now.\nACTION ITEM: Explore tools to handle sensitive health data and comply with data protection policies - WATCH\n\n@30:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, that's awesome, that's awesome. Now, the last part of this question is about that data and the sensitivity that you mentioned about the data, right?\nIt is critical because there's health data involved and there are people who are accessing this data through their mobile devices or their PCs, not under your control, probably all around the place, are there any JNI tools or other tools like you're using to handle that data part of it, where you are constructing data usage or data sharing or whatever.\n\n@31:32 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, we are not using any JNI apart from the chatbot that used to read the, like, executor still query, get a single value, it's okay, see.\nSo, is right, it it is right, right, right, it is right, it is right, it right, it is right, it right, right, right, right, is right, is is it\nlike I don't think government will be happy about doing that. So recently, data protection policy has been built, has been rolled out and that's just been proposed and the policy mandate coming to come So, but like based on that people will see what is the scope based on that.\n\n@32:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in terms of future plans, which is the next question, I think I have three things recognize and summarize healthcare to three week on top of the database.\nI have training and evaluation for the on-ground people. have KPI based on LLM where you understand what's happening and you put that to KPI.\nmean other than in addition to the database that you already going. Anything else that you think, hey, this is my future plan where I'm going go ahead and take this.\nAnd then. will help me or generally the way I will help me out on that.\n\n@33:04 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nWell, the one important thing is EHR, why can't be doing EHR, mapping kind of transcription. So apart from that, pretty much, I think that's it, that's it.\nApart from that, that's a five plus, but we like normal a models, we have other applications, but specific to generic answers, these are the future plans here.\n\n@33:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGetting to things on hindsight, right, now this is purely on hindsight. What do you think in hindsight was the hardest hurdle to get anything genuine on the world?\n\n@33:57 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYeah, all right. Then I still, people are not very much comfortable in adoption, I meant to say. big MNCs who have much level of resources, they are coming up with a more specific use case of I have in the IBM conference, I have seen that particular JNI is again similarly operating, running a query and pulling out their service and forecasting it.\nSo, that is a forecast and it is summarized very much neatly, better than what we are trying to do that I wanted.\nSo, to me, it is still a challenge because the challenges are specific to various cases, first, an NGO, how to adopt necessary resources faster, so we have to go slow and second, we have to be resource-constructive.\nSo, let's list the socialization and maximize the output which is the available human resource, but it's going to take us some time, whether to be open source or not, then government will adopt it.\nSo, because our challenge is government has to adopt, that is our only principle. Government has to adopt whatever we propose and their proposal is open source.\nSo, national health authority of India, so anything we generally call their first question when we are showcasing the product in Karnataka is the product is open source or you are making it as it is still probably good, unless they this step back one through if we say there are some lot of enterprise cost involved.\nSo, what can open source product training the model or fine-tuning the model on our basis, as you mentioned, God railing concepts and improving the accuracy of the system.\nSo, those are the mental challenges, pretty much to everyone, but as an NGO, small skin team, which is a less resource, these are pretty much a big challenge for us to do the faster phase of development.\n\n@36:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat sounds perfect. That sounds perfect. So, I got adoption in terms of people trying to get the technology, I got adoption in terms of the government, one thing open source, and one thing that's just available.\nIn terms of accuracy right now, LLM is not there, so it takes time to get that across. Just a side question, and this is not relevant to this particular interview, but what kind of open source do they accept?\nit like Apache 2, GPL, or what's their intention? I mean, did it find a restricted copyright kind of a thing, or a copyright side does, or how does it work in terms of open source?\n\n@36:55 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nmean, in just open source, they don't want to only copyright, but... it is just cost stream. The solution is cost stream.\nUnderstood.\n\n@37:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo they are ready to take infra-cost but not the solution first. Yeah, exactly. Okay and moving on to the next question.\nWhat is the notable success that you have in terms of generic solution for our company? Has it been that you have been able to save time?\nyes, how much have you been able to save money? yes, how much? So what has been the best success that you have bought?\nAnd how do you want to save it?\n\n@37:33 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay, for me personally and my team time is how I quantify it.\n\n@37:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBecause before we are trying to solve a problem are having a hard time finding the root.\n\n@37:52 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nI can able to easily figure out when it a problem. and finding the root cause so it's like it's some human-like man in the side helping us all the time so that answers in week actions and it saves really a lot of time because nowadays track overflow is outdated kind of I believe because thousands of answers which one even how to pick it's a big mystery so which one is up today which one is world one which version is that striker who really out already for the developers especially that deputy is the best friend right now that says that is there a quantization that you can do in terms of time saved is it like hey I say 20% time 50% time right 80% time more than 10% time whatever okay so\n\n@39:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so I have to write a script, a small script of 10, 20 to 50 lines to do a process.\n\n@39:15 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIt might out to me like, okay, 5 to 10 minutes to write a test state and come up with a script.\n\n@39:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut it probably took me one minute writing the comments and the script generated in the next couple of minutes and I executed it.\n\n@39:36 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo in an average, 50% of my work, I'm as a developer, the party developer is helping us, 50% of the developer time.\n\n@39:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's awesome, that's really great. So, I mean, other than time being one of the multiple successes that you have using Genia, is there any other success that you've had in terms of Genia?\nLike, they haven't been able to reach more people, unable to reach more more languages are able to let's you get more work done or any other parameter where you think it is successful.\n\n@40:10 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay so on particular context.\n\n@40:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo again in the yellow model that we are building for the health of workers that we are piloting. So let's chat the text to do text response as well as ratio response as well as the multi-level response.\n\n@40:36 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo we only uploaded English talk.\n\n@40:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthen LLLA helping us here. Is there a work on uploading knowledge based on different languages? What did that say?\nthen that save you like 200% work, 50% work, I mean you didn't have to do anything other than one language, so I mean that's some company.\nThat time might vary because I have a lot of knowledge based on 80 pages of video, okay.\n\n@41:16 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIf I have to ask someone to convert 80 pages of video to a translation service, I have to invest so much, it is a third party, I have to know some money, also some time, maybe it will take one way to complete the process.\nSo here time and money, I am saving both of them. On the other way, it is that's very common in API challenges for the translation.\nSo again, mostly here, it's the time I can save you.\n\n@41:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo time and money, any number that we can put to it here, I can save 10% by the money during the translation piece of things.\n\n@41:52 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIt depends upon the use case, but I can't. Yeah, I can't have our time to just find a metric because for some people the metrics like the knowledge base document should be very heavier.\n\n@42:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMaybe 120 pages are 300 pages. Obviously we say that, okay, I now spend half the time I used to do the translation or one third because I do three languages.\nYeah, so like, yeah, the number of languages also matters, right? So on that basis, I uploaded the English. So here the time value is very much high.\n\n@42:38 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nI can say 90%.\n\n@42:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's awesome. Now. We are almost one time, but I would need probably five more minutes to cover the rest of the question if that's fine.\nYeah, yeah. Awesome. In terms of biggest revelation that you had doing all this or learning that you had doing all this, what was your biggest\nbiggest learning here when this is like something that that was an insight after you started virtual engineering. Yeah, particularly the IBM conference, I was very much impressed which are their LLM models because what we are building with open source that's kind of fine in the small time as much as the it came out.\n\n@43:34 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo, well, as it's been introduced to the market around 2018-2019 and they have all been in this small time.\nAs soon as the the launch of 3.0 or 3.5, we tend to see a lot of the numbers of the numbers in the LLM model not that one.\nFacebook, IBM, Google, Microsoft. People do hugging things. will find all the smaller one those would be like kind of kind of how this much first of all how they have these many data how much amount of time and results have been invested to build this so much faster.\nThat was very impressive and the IBM model that I have seen it is in Peter Western they are able to release it they haven't even planted the pricing cost that was really impressive even the application performs monitoring it is particularly planning the incident and like I mean I don't think I have to solve it immediately the root cost so this is the problem when you are using some APM tools if APM tools you won't rate it half of the world.\nRight, but this LNO model is going to help us. This is how you make it fix based on the predictions.\nSo that is those things, those things are pretty much like developed in short time. Yeah, they are going to charge us in the market.\n\n@45:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd IBM had a better start. It was already working on Watson. So with Watson.\n\n@45:22 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYeah, what's an X?\n\n@45:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThey had a very early start on that. They were not able to track as much. But yeah, they are going fast.\nI think the biggest revelation or learning that you had was, hey, there is a lot that can be done in a short amount of time.\nIf we have the right is also the right data. Great. So next question, if you have the chance to go back one year with your current knowledge, what would you do differently?\n\n@45:54 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nWell, if I have one back, well, they are What are the LLM things you have seen? might have not.\nFor example, 2019 specifically, around 2019 or 2020, I was in my office. I were really trying to achieve the, or solve the problem of this, and I'll be doing a SQL concept.\nOkay. there was a concept that I was inspired, NLSQL. So it's a site that built that concept very earlier.\n\n@46:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd now it is a entity, right?\n\n@46:34 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nAt that time, it was, now it's a commodity.\n\n@46:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust go and take a model and it takes you five minutes to get it done. Yeah.\n\n@46:40 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo that time I really failed. I really failed.\n\n@46:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have a hard time solving the challenge. I even dropped it.\n\n@46:51 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nNow I took the same project on the hand.\n\n@46:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI completed with it 16 hours maximum. 16-hour understanding model I use one-hour data and a lot more data, 30 billion.\n\n@47:08 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nI simply downloaded it and go through the technical documentation, pulled out certain scheme of material, generated certain sample questionaries, amethyst test data and trained the model and executed it and it replied pretty awesome.\nThe response was very much satisfied. Yeah, the open source models which are doing really, really great in that.\n\n@47:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what I understand is that, hey, if you would have known, you would have said, hey, I don't want to spend time on it.\nI will probably wait for this to come over and then I'll do it, right?\n\n@47:46 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nYeah, exactly. thought was, okay, let's drop it. I don't have time to do it specifically.\n\n@47:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet's say someone is contributing a lot more, so something else I will figure it out and we will build on top of that.\nACTION ITEM: Wait for open source solutions instead of building from scratch for future projects where feasible - WATCH\n\n@48:00 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo that was the thought earlier. Yeah.\n\n@48:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I'm still, I might have a weight that is relevant to these, doesn't care because I'm waiter.\n\n@48:10 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nAlso, going to be open market.\n\n@48:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what is coming up? Totally agree on that, totally agree on that. are a lot of other things that we have been working in terms of education and others.\nI would have waited, thoroughly waited, as I would have known that this is coming up, right? final question that I'm coming up with, it has to part one, what do you think?\nWhat is your judgment? Is AI, Janae AI is super helpful, not helpful, helpful, or getting there or whatever the opinion on how helpful Janae AI is right now.\nthe second part of the question is your recommendation to anybody else who is working at digital transformation for their organization.\nWhat would be your suggestion to them based on what you're talking about?\n\n@48:52 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nOkay, Janae, obviously it's very much super helpful, I can say, it saves us time. You can do it anything on the fly.\nYou can do it anything on the fly, so it's super awesome. But it's all lies in how we are using it a good way through the enterprise itself, putting all their efforts to make the JNI in a way that it should be not biased or other security measures are implemented.\nIf you're using it for a good way, definitely it is going to help you. Again, it's very context. Any technology, use it for good purpose.\nYou will be like, smartphone came, still people are debating. Absolutely.\n\n@49:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nuse it good purpose, it is good.\n\n@49:43 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nSo use it in the right way, and it's helpful.\n\n@49:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what I understand from which our thing is, your recommendation to people is use it for the right purpose, focus on the bias of the security as well, right?\nCan you hear me? Yeah, I said your recommendation to companies are, hey, focus on the right purpose and use it in the right way and be ready of biases and security has to come along, right?\nThat's right. Anything else that you want to share with other people? That's it for now, like, as mentioned, recommendation.\nGenerally, it's not your superior, it's not your superior, definitely. But at the end of the day, when you're delivering it or using it, you have to be very careful going through the pen tent or resource and implemented.\nYeah, that is something that I'm going to go to other people now. This is this is great. Thank you so much.\nThank you for your time. And if I can be of help on any topic that you're looking out at and you need some second pain, complimenting yours or helping you out, just thing, you know, was happy your expertise.\n\n@51:29 - Arulsrinivaasan (Khushi Ba)\nIf you look at my profile, would be able go through that. Thank you.\n\n@51:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you. you much.\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nRajasthan - Karnataka + Maharastra\nPublic heath - NGO/NPO\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\n95\nAnnual - 21 - 983K $ \nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\nGen Ai - Healthcare - Microsoft research\nLLM - front health workers - WhatsApp connect - open source Azure\nHave access to health DB\nTech/Doc/Public heath etc - product / approved to scale - 70K\nTraining - \n\n\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nFront end\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nQuery\nTraining / Evaluation\nMedical Office - 100/150 cases per day - 3 to 5 mins - Transcription system for record\nReduce data entry points and reduce work - less man power - more knowledge - metrics\nKPI - dashborading - will \nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nCI/CD - Monitoring - Gov on Prep Data Centers - All OS - Physical - Bare Metal\nIn house tech - 15/20 - ChatGPT - Github Copilot etc not used\nSensitive Data - \nGPT Teams - \nQuick Stats - IAS meetings - coverage/forecasts/fund raise docs\nData Protection Policy Mandate\n\n\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\nRecognize and summarize - healthcare facilities - planned\nTraining/Evaluation -\nKPI to LLM\nNLP mapping /Transcription\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.

        "content": "So I understand, I am starting recording, I understand Kabuki Investments or Disruptive Evolution, these two I think are the funding funds that you have created with your friend and then you are running these two companies right?\n0:00:00 – 0:00:17\n\nYour ConnectedU and WellRack, is that a correct understanding? Yeah, that is correct. So ConnectedU, I have two more founders, WellRack...\n0:00:17 – 0:00:31\n\nAnd the core business of ConnectedU is basically connectivity solutions and when we narrow down, we come to SIM cards being provided for different providers and connecting basically the providing side and the usage side, right?\n0:00:31 – 0:00:46\n\nWith an application and a SIM card, right? Yeah, that's correct. So we basically offer an orchestration solution on connectivity because when we talk about IoT or machine to machine industry, then people don't really need to connect just in one location.\n0:00:46 – 0:01:03\n\nCompanies need to roll up prices in multiple countries and they don't want to have like 50 different contracts and different SIMs to use and different platforms to manage people. So it's a turnkey solution basically.\n0:01:03 – 0:01:16\n\nExactly. So we can offer a global solution due to our partnerships and integrations with an operating company. That's correct. Okay, and in terms of company size, I mean how many employees and what rough revenues we can put up?\n0:01:16 – 0:01:33\n\nYeah, so we are 11 people today and our revenue last year was around 600,000 euros. 600,000 euros? Yeah.\n0:01:33 – 0:01:46\n\nAlright, that's great. That's good going. And we have heard of AI everywhere and AI moving around. So in terms of the company, in terms of your product, in terms of your internal usage, it's not necessarily that I come up with an AI product or what not, but we are also internally using maybe just to create emails, maybe to create flyers, right? So many different things.\n0:01:46 – 0:02:15\n\nSo in terms of what you see right now, what is the, in your sense, an AI adoption level that you are using right now in the company?\n0:02:15 – 0:02:24\n\nSo right now, I would say mostly around the content creation. So we don't basically have people in the company because we are a small company, we don't have a lot of people or highly skilled people that are creating the right content that resonates with the company. And a lot of us, you know, we've got a product background, so we don't really resonate in our thinking and content creation with what the customer might want.\n0:02:24 – 0:02:53\n\nSo that's one of the big things. In our company, we actually built it, and that's where we started using it six months ago. But now we are slowly starting to use it more and more. Also internally. It's not just content.\n0:02:53 – 0:03:16\n\nSo what tool if any are you using for these purposes and stuff? I mean, are you using a tool, an inbuilt or a chat GPT or what?\n0:03:16 – 0:03:29\n\nWe use chat GPT sometimes also to ask questions or get some understanding of what's the best way to structure our framework or certain blog or content or stuff like that, in the sense we are a little, you know, shorthanded in some way, expert marketing stuff.\n0:03:29 – 0:03:45\n\nSo we use that as well. But then some of the tools are, you know, deeply built. So we use Shopify to run our work and stuff. So there when we are creating content, you know, it gives an option to write something.\n0:03:45 – 0:04:00\n\nIt gives an option of what level or what style of changes to make for you on the content. We can write basically, you know, very data or a product basis based on what is appropriate for us in marketing or whatever.\n0:04:00 – 0:04:22\n\nWe are also trying out recently because we launched and received products. So we are trying out some tools. I have checked the person who tells in that. I have the exact name with me now.\n0:04:22 – 0:04:35\n\nYou are using Sora or probably the Lama video that came out or maybe something like Canva.\n0:04:35 – 0:04:53\n\nI don't exactly have the name with me right now. We haven't decided on which one to use yet. But I know we started trying our launches in a couple of months in the process of trying out different tools.\n0:04:53 – 0:05:08\n\nThere are some open source and some good ones. So in case you are working on, let me know. I will see what I can do for you.\n0:05:08 – 0:05:26\n\nThis is generally in terms of usage within the company for different purposes. But are you trying to integrate AI as an integral part of the product that you are selling or the services that you are selling or your CMS or do you have some of those things in mind?\n0:05:26 – 0:05:47\n\nAnd if yes, where have you reached with that?\n0:05:47 – 0:05:56\n\nThe only thing we could try to do is more on the customer side. We haven't really looked at that.\n0:05:56 – 0:06:23\n\nIf you are buying a 10GB mobile data subscription, it works or it doesn't work. AI can't help.\n0:06:23 – 0:06:43\n\nLet me take it step by step. One, business customer marketing. These are three areas where you are using it right now and generally for content creation mostly is what I understand.\n0:06:43 – 0:06:56\n\nIn terms of usage, in my past experience I have used it for things like where you propose plans or create plans based on the customer's need on the Jiffy. Right now it is very cumbersome if you go ahead and create different forms.\n0:06:56 – 0:07:17\n\nWhat if the person can just share his requirements and you can actually put forward a plan? There is a lot of customer usage around those things in case we need to talk about those things.\n0:07:17 – 0:07:31\n\nThat's just one side of things. In IoT where you are collecting data or are you only providing the network and the connection or are you also putting up background services where you are collecting data and balancing data or warehousing. Are you also into those things?\n0:07:31 – 0:07:56\n\nNo. That's an interesting one. We don't actually touch the actual data traffic. Meaning we just provide the pipe. It's our customers. We actually have quite a few customers who are adopting AI into their products.\n0:07:56 – 0:08:12\n\nWe have customers doing dash cameras or VQC for example to reduce insurance costs. So there they have AI and other things that they are adopting. The length of data, even the process that data is raised, predictions. Our customers actually adopt it much more than we do. For us it's just a pipe.\n0:08:12 – 0:08:37\n\nSo thinking further, let us say in the direction that you have new plans and you have new products coming in, you are going B2C now, right? Do you think that something like an AI or a generative AI in specific would be helpful in that endeavor moving forward?\n0:08:37 – 0:08:57\n\nB2C, it is an interesting one and we are open to it, of course. We are in, as I said, contactless and you know, automatic communication. Introductions on how to merge messages, et cetera, and we are able to generate plans for them on the cloud.\n0:08:57 – 0:09:14\n\nSo there are both stuff that most likely will happen in two months but probably not the first time in a large time moving forward. We ultimately have enough data from initial to first attempt to be able to paint some AI model on how it will work.\n0:09:14 – 0:09:37\n\nWe know there are providers who have proposed this to us, because they have already proposed some data which we do not have. Either we adopt those systems or if it's really a complicated one, we can do it ourselves.\n0:09:37 – 0:09:53\n\nOr maybe buy something from there. That is the interesting one, because if somebody is struggling, you know, it can be a very easy way of understanding the customer behavior and serving them with less of people as well.\n0:09:53 – 0:10:15\n\nIt's a better alignment.\n0:10:15 – 0:10:23\n\nMakes sense. So there are plans basically around prediction and getting things around, but you want to go and first touch base with what you are doing, collect some data and then move ahead in which direction you want to move across.\n0:10:23 – 0:10:38\n\nAnd that would be somewhere around like a three month horizon or a six month horizon.\n0:10:38 – 0:10:44\n\nYeah, I think around the end of this year, we should have good amount of data, around the expense.\n0:10:44 – 0:10:52\n\nAnd our growth behavior as well. And requirements as well, because we also believe that building something just for the sake of it, because it's, you know, a buzzword, there is a different parade, but then does it bring down you to the end?\n0:10:52 – 0:11:07\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:11:07 – 0:11:09\n\nAnd that's exactly what this is about, because right now everybody is talking about it, but is it actually doing any good on the ground? That's what this whole research is about. I mean, if yes, then what?\n0:11:09 – 0:11:22\n\nExactly. Yeah, so for example, we have the capability to create a plan for it in real time. So that's straightforward. Now if it's 30 days options, we can pre-create 30 days options and just let the customer select a slider from a UX perspective.\n0:11:22 – 0:11:42\n\nOr, now we get this vendor coming in saying, hey, I can do this with AI. I'm like, I can do this in two days in a year.\n0:11:42 – 0:11:54\n\nWhat is the additional business value you are providing me?\n0:11:54 – 0:11:58\n\nExactly.\n0:11:58 – 0:12:00\n\nWhat's the benefit?\n0:12:00 – 0:12:02\n\nWhat's going to be the benefit?\n0:12:02 – 0:12:14\n\nAnd, okay, does that matter to the customer? And if yes, how does that matter? What's the actual benefit to the customer? You mean AI is not the customer's benefit. That's not really my benefit, but why would the customer buy it?\n0:12:14 – 0:12:29\n\nMakes sense, makes sense. So, in terms of, let's say, I mean, if we divide the company into different parts, let's say, first being technology, right?\n0:12:29 – 0:12:43\n\nAnd when we say technology, it's basically your CRM that you might be using, your platform that basically connects and allows people to configure SIMs, etc. etc.\n0:12:43 – 0:12:55\n\nAre those in any way using AI and not necessarily generative AI, but AI in general?\n0:12:55 – 0:13:04\n\nNo, not at the moment.\n0:13:04 – 0:13:07\n\nHow about developers? Are developers using some AI tools?\n0:13:07 – 0:13:13\n\nNot at the moment, also not.\n0:13:13 – 0:13:28\n\nProbably we should try if it does, but not at the moment.\n0:13:28 – 0:13:34\n\nYeah, well, I mean, it's all new for us. We started using it on the business and marketing side, on the technology side.\n0:13:34 – 0:13:46\n\nIt's not an official part of the process, if some developer did personally check something, that's something that we should look forward to for what else.\n0:13:46 – 0:14:03\n\nWhich is great. So, if you are planning or rather when you are using these AI tools for marketing and other things, I mean, how do you or what kind of pushback do you get from people?\n0:14:03 – 0:14:15\n\nAnd what kind of or maybe attraction you get from people where, I mean, from the people side, how is this taken and how do you push it further?\n0:14:15 – 0:14:26\n\nI mean, is it like, I can type better, I don't need an AI or is it like, hey, great, give me an AI and I'll do it for you?\n0:14:26 – 0:14:33\n\nWhat kind of a feedback or what kind of a benefit are you getting there?\n0:14:33 – 0:14:38\n\nSo, it's an interesting one. So, just before I answer this, yesterday I was at a school meeting where parents and teachers were talking about, you know, poor kids.\n0:14:38 – 0:14:48\n\nYou learn on the AIs and all that stuff, right? I think it's a part of, because I'm relating it to the fact that I can do it or should I ask AI to do it?\n0:14:48 – 0:14:57\n\nThe question is, do you know what you're doing? No. Maybe learn a little. Is the AI to learn?\n0:14:57 – 0:15:05\n\nSo, it's about personal development versus getting the job done. And that's where, you know, for the kids as well, let them use AI to do everything.\n0:15:05 – 0:15:18\n\nThen, you know, five years later, they probably know, and they know how to use AI. So, that's a valid environment as well that we have.\n0:15:18 – 0:15:30\n\nSo, they can learn more. Okay, we're going to make these actions we want to do.\n0:15:30 – 0:15:36\n\nWe could ask AI, telling them what we want to do, and ask them what other steps and actions we want to do.\n0:15:36 – 0:15:43\n\nThen say, okay, so we know that we should have a list of top 500 that we want to get from. We want to recruit. We want to do that, etc.\n0:15:43 – 0:15:54\n\nNow, for each step, understanding of why are we doing this, what's the relevancy of this, why did AI suggest this.\n0:15:54 – 0:16:01\n\nSo, we do adopt it, but we also make sure we're not blind. So, whenever we use it, we also do it.\n0:16:01 – 0:16:08\n\nSo, you know, giving me the fact, asking me to get an advert for jazzing up the content a little bit.\n0:16:08 – 0:16:15\n\nIt's a good story, but we have to write it first. But then, for these kinds of stuff, we actually have a deep right to go on understanding, so that it's not just what AI is doing.\n0:16:15 – 0:16:26\n\nWe have to be understanding. AI, today, is not only the business world.\n0:16:26 – 0:16:31\n\nToday, if we don't learn ourselves, then we become a gap.\n0:16:31 – 0:16:45\n\nWe do a weekly review on understanding, confidence in ourselves, one page of confidence as part of strategy.\n0:16:45 – 0:16:54\n\nOkay, we are doing this. Why the hell are we doing it?\n0:16:54 – 0:16:56\n\nOh, we're going to do this. Okay, what are the proposals for partnerships? What's happening?\n0:16:56 – 0:17:02\n\nSo, we use AI today to learn about stuff that we might not be aware of, validate our hypothesis.\n0:17:02 – 0:17:09\n\nTo some extent, my thinking is, what do we compare it, et cetera, with gaps? And I think that's helpful, maybe to the point where we definitely push harder on getting an understanding of why we are doing it.\n0:17:09 – 0:17:26\n\nWhat do we know we can ask AI? Why are we doing it?\n0:17:26 – 0:17:39\n\nComing back to my question, from the people's side, in the organization, is it like when they are there and they want to use it, and you are aiding them, or is it like you have a pushback from them?\n0:17:39 – 0:17:53\n\nHey, we don't need this, we can do good ourselves, or how is it from the people's side in the organization?\n0:17:53 – 0:17:59\n\nYeah, so I didn't answer the question exactly, right?\n0:17:59 – 0:18:03\n\nSo, initially, there was a little bit of, you know, that, okay, why should I use AI because I'm an expert at this, or I'm supposed to be an expert at that, am I in the company or not, right?\n0:18:03 – 0:18:16\n\nBut the way we set up the process, eventually, after understanding the challenges around it, then people started to be more reflective of their understanding of it.\n0:18:16 – 0:18:26\n\nIn terms of, you know, if you know it, you know, give me the grades, but if you're going to spend one week research, maybe ask AI, because then you can do one or two hours, you know, time management.\n0:18:26 – 0:18:40\n\nI mean, is your time better here or somewhere else? Based on how, this is around where people are more than AI, but we use AI, let them graduate and learn more and become better at doing their jobs, then they probably become more receptive.\n0:18:40 – 0:18:57\n\nThat makes sense. And that totally makes sense, and that's precisely how others also are trying to push this right now, whether it be a large corporation or a smaller organization.\n0:18:57 – 0:19:19\n\nThe next thing is data, right? So there is a lot of data that you have. A lot of that is proprietary, and you might not want it to be shared outside, but when you are using generative AI, right?\n0:19:19 – 0:19:32\n\nThere's a fair chance that it's being used for learning and then it's being utilized in 10 other places, right? That's one part of it.\n0:19:32 – 0:19:40\n\nAnd the other part is what access to what data would you give to these people around, whether irrespective of the fact whether it uses it for learning or not, but I mean you're cautious about giving data to an AI anyway, right?\n0:19:40 – 0:19:54\n\nSo what's your policy or what's your thought around data and how you manage that being given to the AI and shared out or even being utilized internally?\n0:19:54 – 0:20:05\n\nYeah, so at the moment, something that might be in our minds and strategy down the road is not something that we are feeling into the external.\n0:20:05 – 0:20:16\n\nSo we don't have anything internally built. That's one thing to have outside, right? So we are not feeling what are we planning a year later?\n0:20:16 – 0:20:26\n\nWhat are we doing today? What are we doing right now that we already like as a business? And we're not going to have content and stuff like that.\n0:20:26 – 0:20:36\n\nThe other thing is, okay, we're talking about the same thing in a couple of months. It's basically now kind of a thing.\n0:20:36 – 0:20:43\n\nThe point is, it won't be the ground-breaking that we're working on, you know, for the next one year or year or something. Then how do we make sure we select as we buy, very specifically, which ones are allowed for it?\n0:20:43 – 0:20:59\n\nWe have different documents that we can keep it up on, you know, Excel and stuff. The tools and where the type of documentation can go on.\n0:20:59 – 0:21:14\n\nSo we don't have any state to write or something secretive, but at least we want to keep some of those anything.\n0:21:14 – 0:21:29\n\nSo you are not using it to create those secretive internal documentation to be shared with the customer. You're just using it for external marketing and other purposes, so it doesn't hamper that much.\n0:21:29 – 0:21:41\n\nAnd have you created some processes around it with the organization like, hey, you have to use AI to save two hours per week or some process around the fact that you ensure that people start using it somehow and get better at it?\n0:21:41 – 0:21:56\n\nSo, yeah, I think what we found is that, you know, generally people don't like it when we enforce, hey, you have to use this or do something for two hours a week or five hours a week, etc.\n0:21:56 – 0:22:10\n\nBut we try to do it. We create, let's say, what do we plan, we break it down into, you know, eventually we can break it from a weekly delivery.\n0:22:10 – 0:22:26\n\nAnd we say, okay, then this particular week, week number 47 or whatever, these are all right in order to be delivered.\n0:22:26 – 0:22:34\n\nNow, that's a completely different culture and a process where we don't actually care what time you work, we don't care what day you work, we don't care how you work, who you use or how you do it.\n0:22:34 – 0:22:45\n\nBut, so, we ensure there is enough quality of work to make the work automatic, which is people, to my skin and our environment. And ultimately, we, as a business, we shouldn't actually care about whether people use AI or not. We are not here as a business, you know, create a big world for AI.\n0:22:45 – 0:23:06\n\nMake sense, make sense, absolutely.\n0:23:06 – 0:23:16\n\nAnd we need to do the right thing for it, whether you want to use AI as long as the job gets done, right? But of course, you have enough work on the table and create a culture and process for people to do some things that you don't think you can do or some other stuff, where they start to learn it in you. And they automatically feel that, hey, okay, this is right.\n0:23:16 – 0:23:37\n\nAnd you think, okay, that was supposed to be done in this week. All of that is on your mind this day, right? And then over the next weeks, you try to adapt more and how can we create more work to burden people, how we are more optimized, you know, in terms of our working. It's a little slow process.\n0:23:37 – 0:23:57\n\nSo what I understand is that instead of implementing, hey, use AI and save time, what you would rather do is probably gradually increase the amount of work so that the person who is using it would actually look out for some outlet where he can save his own time and get the same productivity out.\n0:23:57 – 0:24:23\n\nAnd what do you think about the? Sorry, go ahead.\n0:24:23 – 0:24:28\n\nAnd it has led to all the people thinking outside the box. Sometimes in new AI, maybe they come up with another idea to do it, but they actually matured people in a different way as well.\n0:24:28 – 0:24:40\n\nWhich is great. The other side which comes to a working culture like this, right, is the evaluation part. So here the onus lies on the person who is accepting the output from the other people.\n0:24:40 – 0:24:56\n\nSo it actually the onus travels upwards in this where the person accepting has to be very, very versant and very, very strong in evaluating and understanding and guiding further. Hey, this doesn't meet my criteria.\n0:24:56 – 0:25:11\n\nYou have to change it or this doesn't make the mark. So you have to probably upgrade the way that you're thinking or you're acting or what you're delivering, right?\n0:25:11 – 0:25:19\n\nSo for those, are you planning to use like some AI tools for evaluation to assist or is that manageable right now?\n0:25:19 – 0:25:27\n\nMaybe at a time when it doesn't get manageable, then you would think of it. Let me save some my own time or time of my higher ups to automate the evaluation or maybe have at least some benchmark.\n0:25:27 – 0:25:39\n\nWhich is, okay, it passes the basic benchmark and now I want to do further. So it saves my time. Yeah, at the moment, we might be a little early in that as a company.\n0:25:39 – 0:25:52\n\nBut as we know, definitely that would be interesting for us. Yeah, we basically, a lot of work might take it away as well. And again, verifying, you know, 100% of the work means that then the guy has to go and do all of it again and then verify.\n0:25:52 – 0:26:13\n\nBut, you know, it's not like a deep relationship. So you have to completely empower them and let them come out with it.\n0:26:13 – 0:26:22\n\nDo I know what I'm asking? Do I know what I'm asking? What do you expect now? The definition of work, if you give it clearly enough, then on a deeper level, you know that yes, this has been given or not.\n0:26:22 – 0:26:42\n\nWhat I don't know is, unless I do it myself, if I ask somebody to give me X number of countries with certain amount of data, now I can measure that the work product has been done on certain level.\n0:26:42 – 0:26:57\n\nBut I don't know if the actual content is accurate, unless I do the work right now. But then the question is, how can AI verify that we do it? Then how can we do that? We need that.\n0:26:57 – 0:27:12\n\nSo I think all of us are sharing. We are also learning. We are not experts in this. We are learning about new information. We are learning about where we get stuck in that, hey, this is going to take a long time. How do I know? I'm against the world. How do I know where it is?\n0:27:12 – 0:27:26\n\nWe are in a situation where today we are looking to it, and we are not perfect. It's ours. And then we look at options, and are there AI options or are they out there for somebody, right, and that costs money as well.\n0:27:26 – 0:27:43\n\nSo it's financial, people are doing it so hard, and what are the options available? And that's where we're using it. We have a problem with adding and responding to people in terms of how we are getting the outcomes and results around it.\n0:27:43 – 0:28:00\n\nSo we are also positively taking more work from it. And I would say more and more people are willing to work on it. So then you know how to further use it, how to better out the process.\n0:28:00 – 0:28:24\n\nThat's right. And a lot of organizations I'm talking to, their take is, hey, we have a very clear definition of done, right. We have a clear benchmark, and that is what we can evaluate.\n0:28:24 – 0:28:35\n\nSo for evaluation, there's a very big use case that companies are using where they want to save time. So hey, I mean, instead of having two, three to end flows, what I would rather have is that the person directly submits to an AI, the AI says, oh, these are the basic flaws that are there.\n0:28:35 – 0:28:51\n\nAnd instead of the two, three to end flows, I would rather have one to end flow, which does my job and saves me time and effort, right. So that's how we are doing it right now.\n0:28:51 – 0:29:01\n\nWe are at time. I would need 10 more minutes if you have, or we can probably skip that. Awesome.\n0:29:01 – 0:29:11\n\nSo the next part is, I understand the culture part as well. And if I understand the culture part correct, and you can let me know if my understanding is correct or not on this is that the focus here is on what is being delivered and not what tools you are using.\n0:29:11 – 0:29:29\n\nAnd the idea is that to make you use AI more, I would rather slowly ramp up on how much we are trying to get done in a particular amount of time, so that you automatically try and figure out what are the tools available to get that thing done in a lesser amount of time or better quality or whichever way you want to take the direction. Is that a correct understanding of the culture?\n0:29:29 – 0:29:55\n\nThat is correct. Great. And the last part is operations. So in our, so one side is the part where our tool is being used by the customers. And one part is where our operations are commencing, right.\n0:29:55 – 0:30:13\n\nWe would have an internal ERP system or an internal MIS, right. Is AI right now a part of this internal system somewhere or is it like, no, it is just content generation for now and I don't want to be utilizing it for that internal MIS or understanding of data or I mean within the company, the operations of the company.\n0:30:13 – 0:30:40\n\nSo at the moment it's mostly around the business and marketing side of things. On the operations side, we are not against it, but we don't want to use it anywhere today.\n0:30:40 – 0:30:53\n\nMost of our operations are, let me put it this way, we don't use it today. Maybe based on the culture and practice as they come against the wall, they will try and figure out, okay, how to do this, how better are you thinking about it, right.\n0:30:53 – 0:31:13\n\nSo as you can see we are a big and a small company. A lot of it is due to the publishing process. We do adopt a lot of things.\n0:31:13 – 0:31:31\n\nNow, based on the culture, I think it's going to happen sooner or later. It's going to be a long time, because that's what we have to think about.\n0:31:31 – 0:31:43\n\nThat makes sense and this is probably the most important part of the entire segment is, assuming what you said is correct, that everything is hunky-dory and things are what they seem to be and what we have heard and the rest of the market has proved that.\n0:31:43 – 0:32:11\n\nAnd Vicky's report says, 50 people are using it for this particular purpose and since 50 people are using it, that means it's proven and it's tested, I also probably want to figure out something that I want to go ahead and work out on this.\n0:32:11 – 0:32:23\n\nWhat would be your future visions in respect, hey, everything is hunky-dory, assume you have the magic wand, all is done. Now, what would be the areas in the business where you think that it would really make a dent?\n0:32:23 – 0:32:36\n\nNow this is purely business and nothing technical, right?\n0:32:36 – 0:32:41\n\nSo, I think as we grow as a company, and I'll talk about our company, one of the biggest aspects of the operational process, especially when you work with me as a company, how you deal with things, how these operations happen. People say my product is flawless, but then they have a thousand people completely supporting that product.\n0:32:41 – 0:33:04\n\nSo, that's one of the biggest aspects of costs and profitability and growth that we face as well.\n0:33:04 – 0:33:13\n\nNow, that's one of the big aspects and how that can be solved.\n0:33:13 – 0:33:19\n\nWell, for example, we have, let's say, five million customers and what we have, let's include the buyers, right? If an issue happens which I'm taking back to one of the buyers and linking that customer and getting it from end-to-end, that's a very tough process that can bring a dollar value.\n0:33:19 – 0:33:43\n\nOf course, you have the customer to solve the problem, but you have to include the customer as well there, but especially around the department, right?\n0:33:43 – 0:33:51\n\nYou don't actually have to have a personal engagement because the end consumer just cares about that if an issue is resolved. So, how can AI basically help diagnose what the problem is and not just within one system, but across the ecosystem of systems and supplier platforms and basically help ensure that.\n0:33:51 – 0:34:15\n\nI think for us at the company, because that's our situation, that would be a very old part of it if we can get to that one day.\n0:34:15 – 0:34:25\n\nSo, we have been able to get to that. That's the good part. In one of the US organizations, we have been able to get to that.\n0:34:25 – 0:34:33\n\nSo, we were able to cut their 75% of almost their support team, right? Because most of the L1 generally can be taken out in this way. It can automatically do the checks, it can do a lot of things which can be done while the person is chatting to the AI.\n0:34:33 – 0:34:53\n\nWhich is great. I agree with you that L1 is probably the first step for us because implementing that across your partners and supplier systems and all of that is a little bit of a mirror ask, but hopefully the world gets there one day.\n0:34:53 – 0:35:13\n\nI think that's where we would like to be. Today it's not a huge problem for us, but I know we are into the B2C side of things especially. Today we are into B2B, but now we are into B2C.\n0:35:13 – 0:35:26\n\nSo, I think B2C, that's where I feel that's a very key area where we would want to look at it.\n0:35:26 – 0:35:32\n\nI mean, this is what comes with amount of money. Even another 1,000 but this is the first thing that comes which is generally true.\n0:35:32 – 0:35:43\n\nYeah, I mean it's basically in terms of everything that we do in business. We have to attach it to a dollar value.\n0:35:43 – 0:35:51\n\nAnd when we talk about support and the amount of dollars that support can save if it's scaled that way, that's really impressive the way it works out. In the case of the company I'm talking it was a few million dollars, in this case it might be a few million Euros as you grow.\n0:35:51 – 0:36:08\n\nYeah, exactly. And ultimately, if we can save that, ultimately consumers don't pay it, but every dollar value that is our cost is eventually built into the price to the customer.\n0:36:08 – 0:36:21\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:36:21 – 0:36:22\n\nSo, if we save that, then we can also complete better and grow business better in the market and give better value to the customers as well.\n0:36:22 – 0:36:30\n\nAbsolutely. Now looking at some hindsight questions, these are like pop quiz kind of questions. So, looking at the hindsight, what was the hardest hurdle or still is the hardest hurdle in implementing JNI solutions for you in your opinion?\n0:36:30 – 0:36:47\n\nYeah, I don't think we look at it, we don't have a program in a company. One of these that you said was that you are still not sure if it's still there, right? The other one that you said was…\n0:36:47 – 0:37:05\n\nWe are not sure in terms of like should we use it for everything. So, today what we are focusing on is we have basically a small firm which means they are the future leaders of the company.\n0:37:05 – 0:37:20\n\nSo, when we believe in them, we want them to learn and grow. It's okay to use AI to learn, but we are not really confident in terms of AI taking over the future leader of the company and having dumb people giving instructions to AI.\n0:37:20 – 0:37:35\n\nI don't know what to do, problem, figure out a solution and do it for me, right? I don't think we want to have that in a company. So, I think that's where we want to be careful on today.\n0:37:35 – 0:37:50\n\nUltimately, we want to have, it's okay to have a self-driving profitability, but we still believe as a business, we want to have somebody who is driving the business, building confidence for the shareholders and their value and the value for the customers.\n0:37:50 – 0:38:08\n\nSo, if I replay back what you said, what you are trying to say is that hey, I mean it's great and all and it takes over and does everything, but I would like to keep a check on what it is doing and finally delivering, right? And that is what is critical.\n0:38:08 – 0:38:25\n\nYeah, I mean we still value people's intelligence more and we want to build that intelligence. We can say okay, I know a thousand things today, but as early stage company and leaders in the company, we want to make sure we are building the future leaders of the company and they don't turn out to be dumb because they had an assistant doing it for them.\n0:38:25 – 0:38:46\n\nRight. And what is your, what is the place where you feel AI has so far been the biggest success and if I understand from what we have had a discussion so far, it has been basically generation of content and things around that, correct?\n0:38:46 – 0:39:06\n\nFor us, yes. And I think that's where we have so far seen the biggest value. As we go into the G side, we would love to see how we can use it in our operations and support side of areas as well.\n0:39:06 – 0:39:20\n\nBut besides that, today we don't see again, look for options and ideas when you are going to walk. Otherwise, you know, you're walking into a company and going along. We don't really spend time, we don't have a program where we are saying okay, we have to implement this and evaluate this and how we can improve our company.\n0:39:20 – 0:39:44\n\nSo, we are not that big yet. Maybe if we were 10 years down the road, then maybe we will have a dedicated program, people looking into stuff. But we don't have it. So, today our situation is very simple, a small company.\n0:39:44 – 0:39:56\n\nWhen you are up against the wall, then you look at what the options are. And today, we are using a business model. It delivers really good value. Operations, I would love to see how it can work.\n0:39:56 – 0:40:07\n\nThat's great. That's great. And fingers crossed, not 10 years, maybe 5 years down the line, I'd hear you were doing that already.\n0:40:07 – 0:40:16\n\nWhat is the biggest revelation or learning that you had while seeing all this jazz happening around you, doing it, helping your team do it? What do you think is the biggest elevation?\n0:40:16 – 0:40:32\n\nWhat do you think is that you have learnt out of this particular thing happening in the world recently? Is it like valuing people more or maybe you have dependence on these things will increase?\n0:40:32 – 0:40:46\n\nWhatever your revelation or whatever you are learning out of this JNI wave coming around in the world that gives you?\n0:40:46 – 0:40:56\n\nI think one of the important things I have said is knowing what and how, even in our context, we are just using it to generate confidence and understanding of saying, okay, what should be our marketing strategy?\n0:40:56 – 0:41:11\n\nWhat is the best marketing strategy for a certain kind of product in certain markets? If you ask this question, will you use certain things?\n0:41:11 – 0:41:21\n\nAbsolutely. The question is how do I validate? Does it make sense what AI told me? Should I just go ahead and do it based on what AI told me?\n0:41:21 – 0:41:33\n\nBecause whether you consult a person and pay them for it or you consult AI, consultation makes you more and more free.\n0:41:33 – 0:41:41\n\nHow about any consequences? So there is no responsibility for any person, whether it is a human or an AI telling me to do something. There is no consequence. They are not going to take a million dollar loss.\n0:41:41 – 0:41:52\n\nI think responsibility for it. I think that is one of the big items is understanding where you play.\n0:41:52 – 0:42:01\n\nSo don't overuse in places where you have a person who you take responsibility for making processes with things in a certain way, right?\n0:42:01 – 0:42:12\n\nAnd that person could have done it for me. If it comes back to me and says, I don't care and I don't know, all I did was ask the AI to blame AI, right?\n0:42:12 – 0:42:21\n\nSo that is one of the things which is very scary from a revelation perspective is what can AI actually tell you a lot? Even though it is a con, right? It is pretty good that way.\n0:42:21 – 0:42:32\n\nIt talks a lot of bullshit as well.\n0:42:32 – 0:42:35\n\nIt does, right? If you ask the right questions, it tells you something, you know. The important thing is, the real revelation for us is that, okay, I am going to say things. We are not just going to do everything the AI tells us to do, right? Either you do it, take responsibility for it, give us the end result, right?\n0:42:35 – 0:42:54\n\nOr be careful around that no step-by-step approach. And that is why it is important today for us to make sure that we learn from it, we enrich our own mind with the knowledge, we ask questions, we validate and verify what AI has asked us to do.\n0:42:54 – 0:43:12\n\nBecause we usually don't need the learning. Content generation is okay, we gather it, it doesn't meet our requirement, we make some changes to it and post it, right? But then when we are using it, then we also need to understand, while we are learning, okay, it makes sense.\n0:43:12 – 0:43:28\n\nMy second last question to you.\n0:43:28 – 0:43:54\n\nIf you can turn back a year, the technology that you know as of now and you get that one year earlier, what would you do differently than you have done in the last one year?\n0:43:54 – 0:44:09\n\nYeah, interesting. We don't normally look back that much. Maybe use the different AI more early. I don't think we would have done too much on the other side.\n0:44:09 – 0:44:27\n\nI think that's where we have adopted it. And based on how we use the AI thought process, we cannot be perfect, by the way, as humans. So that's where we make decisions that are not always right.\n0:44:27 – 0:44:39\n\nBut I think the only thing I would say is we might have started doing it more earlier, less, I think, inspired people or have better outcomes of adoption of the thing maybe.\n0:44:39 – 0:44:57\n\nThose are things that have changed because we didn't see an area where we have adopted it, how it works and then how it can be used better. It gives us more confidence slowly to see how we can adopt it in more practical areas where we are still concerned.\n0:44:57 – 0:45:15\n\nRight, that's good. And the last question. What is your recommendation for companies looking at achieving digital transformation through generative AI?\n0:45:15 – 0:45:24\n\nI already have the fact that, and these are the two carry-away lines that I'm going to take from this interview. And I'm going to probably put that out in golden words and get them framed somewhere.\n0:45:24 – 0:45:36\n\nNumber one, you need to know what and how something should be done. AI you should use to deep dive, use as a tool to learn, validate the hypothesis, plan, execute also.\n0:45:36 – 0:45:49\n\nBut know what is to be done and how is to be done is your job, it's not the AI's job. It's just a tool that assists you in that. That's the first one that I'm taking away.\n0:45:49 – 0:46:01\n\nThe second one that I'm taking away is dude, the end result is your responsibility. It doesn't matter if the AI said it or whoever said it.\n0:46:01 – 0:46:09\n\nEnd of the day, the end result is yours, right? Yeah. So these are the two things that you are saying?\n0:46:09 – 0:46:19\n\nNo, I think, I mean, we feel or I personally feel that. I mean, that's how it is. So what is AI?\n0:46:19 – 0:46:26\n\nAs a business leader, I think the question relating to the question around digital transformation, right? I think we understand it's very important that these are investing millions in digital transformation.\n0:46:26 – 0:46:40\n\nAnd we talked about some of the bigger customers and what we're doing and we see that as well, right?\n0:46:40 – 0:46:44\n\nNow the question is, I think you have to follow the AI and you need to decide. Today, you already have the ecosystem wherein you have leaders, you have managers, you have business leaders, then you have shareholders and stakeholders.\n0:46:44 – 0:47:00\n\nThese are internal activities, right? And then you have tools that help the people do different jobs in different ways, right?\n0:47:00 – 0:47:08\n\nThe question is, is AI, what are you replacing in that ecosystem with AI? Are you replacing people?\n0:47:08 – 0:47:15\n\nI'm not saying it's right or wrong. I think what I'm saying is as a company, you need to make that decision for us and then that goes out to other firms. What am I replacing?\n0:47:15 – 0:47:24\n\nWhat is your priority? What is the objective? Are you replacing employees or do you feel that managers, AI can actually manage better and evaluate the work that is coming and improve that quality?\n0:47:24 – 0:47:39\n\nSo I think you have to ask, is it just a tool that will help people to learn and grow and improve? And it could be multiple places, right? So I think both of the questions are in a different way from a whole digital job to a project.\n0:47:39 – 0:47:54\n\nBecause just they adopt AI for digital transformation in doing what? Doing everything. We want them to run the whole business and decide what dividends the company pays out to shareholders.\n0:47:54 – 0:48:08\n\nSo you have to break it down into actors, whether it's an individual or a role, I would say individual person, but a role in the company as an employee role.\n0:48:08 – 0:48:18\n\nFrom there, all the tools can come. And then you decide, where are the areas you want to try it? What is your key point that you're trying to pull?\n0:48:18 – 0:48:28\n\nAre you just trying to play with it because it's a place where you have a lot of money to play around? Even if that's the case, you're going to do it right, right?\n0:48:28 – 0:48:35\n\nThat's right.\n0:48:35 – 0:48:36\n\nStart somewhere, identify the area, slowly incorporate there, see how the learning is, and you can do it in different places.\n0:48:36 – 0:48:43\n\nBut important is what is the role of AI in your company? And then people, they're like, oh, I know that AI, there's a role of AI. My question is forget that.\n0:48:43 – 0:48:54\n\nTalk about either tools or people role, how an individual person has a role of the company, right?\n0:48:54 – 0:49:01\n\nIs it the supporting? Is it somebody who would vote for you? Like who are you trying to replace in the person?\n0:49:01 – 0:49:08\n\nIs it that you want to replace or you want to improve the quality or you want to reduce the time? What is your objective? What's the final objective?\n0:49:08 – 0:49:17\n\nYeah, right. It's a role. And then you want to reduce cost. That means that either you're replacing or stopping or hiring or you want to improve the quality, right?\n0:49:17 – 0:49:28\n\nSo come up with the right objective and then it will help you apply the adoption in the right way. That's my two cents.\n0:49:28 – 0:49:38\n\nAnd we haven't, you know, we are going through the process ourselves. I think that things are approaching right now. We would love to adopt it more as we go forward. But also our mindset and I can understand with everybody out there, but that's what makes us even.\n0:49:38 – 0:50:03\n\nThat's good. That's good. And thank you so much for us for so much time. I'm stopping the reporting now.\n0:50:03 – 0:50:08\n\nNo.\n0:50:08 – 0:50:08\n\nThank you for watching our video.\n0:50:08 – 0:50:10\n\n\nKabuki Investments (16 France) + Disruptive Evolution ApS (17 Denmark)\nConnectedYou + VELRAG\n\nOrchestration of connection - Turnkey global solution\n\n11 people 600K Euros\n\nAI Adoption Level - Content Creation \nChat GPT - Shopify\n\nNo plans yet\nBusiness Customer Marketting\n\nCustomers doing AI\n\nB2C - Open - Plan Predictions\nInitial Data 6 month horizon - based on customers\n\nPeople - \n\nDo you know what you are doing? \nPushback - process - research (where can time be used better) - better job\n\nData - \n\nProcess - donot like enforce \n\nOperational Process\n\nKnowing what and how something should be done - Deep Dive and use Ai for Learn, Validate Hypothesis, Planning, Execution\n\nFocus on End result responsibility is yours not AI\n\nRight objective / adoption\n\n\n\n\n",

Yes, yes, I can.\n\n@0:09 - Malkeet Singh\nAwesome, yes, right.\n\n@0:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGood. I just had a call to depend. Now you. Based on the pangak, either of you. I'm here. I have good memories of Pangak.\nare so. In the year of 2004, you know, MCM now. The West College. I automated that in 2004, I guess.\nNow in 4 years, I have. We stayed at MCM campus. had a good time with MCM campus. More of the other.\nSo, I don't know if it's still there or not. I can't use an idea. So, have been operating from the U.S.\nbut on the right-hand market somebody goes around and stuff on. Two questions and we need to have a plan to figure out what answers are.\nSorry, sorry to interrupt. That's fine. It's more about your convenience and what you think. So, is not specific in some way G, we will have to prepare for it, it is not required.\nI come back to my question about that. I have been working in America since the beginning of You mean question.\nTo do something, you know, just turn on the camera. I think that the camera has been like bad camera.\nmean, is not same. camera, So, the industry that you are in comes a industry, what do you call the industry and sector, where is in the industry not a sector who goes around?\n\n@2:55 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, basically, let me talk about myself. So basically like I am in an IT company which is a service based company or a year is it like related to blockchain, mobile application, website development, that kind of stuff.\nSo Agramabath Chrome, AI key, so we may currently use Agram within my company. Obviously in order to write some content using chat GPT, yeah, other AI tools available and as of now.\nEven we are using the AI tool. In order to generate some code script, for example, GitHub co-pilot hat, GitHub by co-pilot hat that is for a freelancer and dual person that we are using right now in order to speed up the things on a code site.\nFor example, for example, example, example, example, example, for example, example, for example, for example, for example, for for example, for for example, for for example, for for for example, example, example, example, for example, number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number\nSo, that application later to a body measurement will put in measurement API 2 in that API sorry in that mobile application we use body ground in order to measure measurement for the body parts.\nSo, that kind of stuff like we did in the EI as of now and and we still have to see here the content of Gareme Helplana which is a document prepared Korna, Gareme Helplana like we are mainly Jummarik of NEM blockchainsite have here writing this model that we are taking help of generating the EI in order to speed up the things even from test cases we get a little bit you say development side to Jummarik Helplana.\nSo, most of them, Gareme even, Gareme Gareme Helplana, Gareme Helplana So, we have a core development team here, but pre-trained model, we will use the same models to provide the JSON file for using XML kind of stuff, to provide the same basically.\nSo, it's a major recommendation that have to explore here, the four options, EVM-non-EVM smart contract that kind of stuff like that.\nSo basically Amari has to software development company has received software development company has or in kapu yepna product nahi hai they are providing a like a services based on agarpil line tire let's say this is service platform in a non-lika of work relauncing that kind of one of two ones is a business team have also a project to get on a or a then post problem you should provide karna using technology all but here more than one so if you have a company you have company have a have a you company you you have a company you have a company you have company you have company\nAnybody company in small scale also? 55 or 10 I guess he is an idea and he has to repeat.\n\n@8:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI guess, I mean, it's just 40 girls, 10 girls, 100 girls, 100 girls. think it's rough view.\n\n@8:23 - Malkeet Singh\nHow expect to go to So, it's about 50,000 per month.\n\n@8:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm sorry, 55.\n\n@8:42 - Malkeet Singh\n50,000 per month. I'm six schools, U.S. buildings. One of the rough estimates now, one of goals I've built.\n\n@9:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou are on mute.\n\n@9:20 - Malkeet Singh\nI'm fifty-five people, right?\n\n@9:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm fifty-five people.\n\n@9:24 - Malkeet Singh\nPlease, make clear that just know the idea of could be ten grow USD.\n\n@9:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo problems, no problems. I just need a basic number, Q, Barty. don't know if just know the I said get the guy, I understand that.\nThat's a proper combination.\n\n@9:50 - Malkeet Singh\nGreat.\n\n@9:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, here is something that we currently have at the adoption level, Jai company, but look Kahamlukolai abhi already. We are using a huge company.\nWe are using a huge company. We are a huge We are using huge company.\n\n@10:13 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, I guess we are already doing it. We are providing it right now. are using pre-trained models as I mentioned.\nWe are using third-party platform, AIS. Using those AIS, we are just providing the solutions. So, in that perspective, if I say, yeah, we are using it right now.\n\n@10:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd here, the normal ML AI model is a generated AI model.\n\n@10:51 - Malkeet Singh\nSee, it will depend on both hands. can see. And many people say,\n\n@11:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, it makes sense. Why specific, the other blockchain may write are focused mainly in the blockchain, so anything specific in terms of AI that we are picking up or a project that we are working on, specific as AI sort of, it's just other tool that we are utilizing it right now.\n\n@11:25 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, blockchain came up with a combination of blockchain and AI is, in terms of, in order to search filters, I guess, you are likely to make a search more dynamic and more user friendly.\nSo, we used, like, AI, chat, charge, GPT, AI, or post, speed up and that kind of stuff.\n\n@11:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, basically, question, answer kind of scenario that we going to use here, right? Alright, awesome, awesome. If we break this down a bit, right?\nAnd we look at different parts, Agai, Kijun, let's try to keep goals in. So, company, Guwahana, Agai, Parana, we want to grow, we want to do things.\nJust make way, generate it here, and select Agai, Agai, Agai, very strategic goals and benefits come over. Is there anything like that?\n\n@12:35 - Malkeet Singh\nSee, as I mentioned, like on AI side, because we are a software development company, it should be must for us nowadays, like, we should top the AI technology in terms of developing the AI models within our company.\nSo, we should grab that skill, like, how to grow. it over on LLLM models that kind of stuff. So that, as mentioned, we are using a product part here is that that is in order to build application.\nTo go home, it's going to collect the company which innovation company, up and up with model, where I up and up of any minor, but maybe in future, there will be a, like we are thinking and we are discussing, we were discussing within, I guess, maybe disclosing it from Microsoft, but maybe with the combination of blockchain and AIP, there will be one, up and up and up.\n\n@14:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbasically it may be with blockchain and AI as a mix right yeah okay I'm not sure what detail we don't need to do it um you have been using things right I'm not paying anybody who's here I can get any use here but it's focused on specific parts right it was given back to the technology infrastructure but technology infrastructure we have had development this may have data provided so we are uh personal AI use infrastructure over tools like these right and infrastructure development key scripts cicv pipelines right we are up here because the two testing pipelines are gonna come and so on so uh have you been using that in the past or something so using AI basically for a cicv for cicv pipeline we use like a jenkin captain of tools i guess are you familiar with jenkin okay so\n\n@15:01 - Malkeet Singh\nAs I mean using AI, using AI, using AI, using a pipeline setting up key on our co-site container where I use AI using Docker, that kind of stuff.\nBut I must say, you have to explore on that site like other CICD, may or may help create AI too.\nBut just say GitHub, again, which may help full head, guess, like in order to create separate branches and then merge the code between separate branches into master, that kind of stuff.\nguess we can handle. But CICD, side of the here, so I'm going to go some manual here, using Jenkins code, that stuff.\nYou are mute.\n\n@16:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut we'd rather using this and generally grid of action, banking is a big infrastructure development, yes, are also buying a new case, or who generally rides, because that's the good opportunity.\nAnd the year we get excited, but no way to put people management in the trikea, in terms of local, us say whether the sentiments are good or not, and whether they are improving and the people are not, right?\nOr something, this may, I'm not going to apply and you're to apply it to the other side. I'm not apply it to the other side.\nAnd it's good, And it's going to a new case, it's going this case will case.\n\n@16:52 - Malkeet Singh\nbe case. I'm going to improve just using it or in order to, you know, then it's the attempt and leaves, you see, so apart from my don't think right now they are maybe looking, but we can do more maybe in order to observe the behavior and that kind of stuff.\nI must say use key at hand, but in order to manage the attendance and I guess sell a restructure as a leave structure like if someone is on a paid leave operation, you know, the basic automations is mostly what I'm going to use carry.\n\n@17:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIn terms of process, we'll get what you feel, but we'll have to look at what to is it like, by the way, you should not go to AI because it's not 100% accurate, is it like, estimating your culture that you want to develop around AI, you are already using an AI.\nACTION ITEM: Find ways to skill up existing employees and technology leaders within the company on AI tools and concepts in order to expand the AI team within the next two years - WATCH\n\n@18:27 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, basically, according to me, as we are a development company, so when a presser, let's say, when a presser comes to me and he asks me to use the AI tool and that kind of stuff, I always recommend, yeah, you should go with the AI, but you should have a basic knowledge of, if you are using the AI scripting in your code, mean, but you should have a basic knowledge of code, like how you can use, how you can\nand generate a script and how you can cut and paste that script into your code. So obviously like a owner culture perspective we always recommend to use AI in order to be more fast in deliveries to be productive with the code.\nSo in that kind of stuff we are using the AI. And even Mesa recommended our content, whether we knew a person who knew technology, they are offering basic concept clear growth.\nOr I guess the general method that we may as a developer may not be to come here to ask for my experience, either after basic concept clear and or you are on a good or on side in order to use the AI.\nThen you can manage, you know, difficult code and you can write the difficult code as well. I was going to integrate because we are going to have basic knowledge.\n\n@20:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut in terms of us say and other operations like maybe whatever kind of operation you want, human operations or maybe client in a right marketing company here, are we using somewhere in that generative here?\n\n@20:42 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, basically, first one on DevOps side as you mentioned, so DevOps side like we are using cloud clouds, whether it is Azure, it is AWS, so they are already using AI in order to solve by account stacks.\neven I can check the stats related to a particular instance I mean how is reacting at what time what kind of traffic was there is there any attack is there any security a lot and even there is a recommendation from AI to itself like you need to enable that kind of you know security check so on your instance also so in that I mean on that side in that kind of work we are already using AI which is you know provided by the platform which we are working with as as a add-on services you know development company yes so and regarding the business side so let's take an example of app work itself so yeah we are on app work and I must say\nThey are providing nowadays AIE chat box over there, so they are helping you in order to write a proper content, a proper cover note while you are applying to a business or to a job.\nSo, yeah, the AIE is everywhere, whether it is a tab of whether it is a business site or applying for a job using AIE tool.\n\n@22:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, okay, and in terms of future apps, right, and this is like very simple, I have a very interesting idea, you.\n\n@23:13 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, how do you plan in terms of team coming to the side of the community? even I want to create more and more employment opportunities for the company, I guess now there is a lot of unemployment in the market, so I want to create them for the company.\nSo obviously in that case, I will try to use the way where I could take the benefits but on the other side, I will make sure like how it will be beneficial in terms of employment for the companies and\nAnd even in my company, like I must say, on an AI side, so as I already mentioned, it is here to export, so for our next two years, I would love to expand over my team in two AIs, like right now, I have 55 folks, professionals who are working in web development team, mobile development team, and using blockchains.\nMira Tarket, Google, 55,000, or 45 people, Mary, AI, who are working on AI applications, mobile applications with website side, and also including in like four AI models, AI models, they are doing product together, which is a product coming soon, that kind of stuff.\nACTION ITEM: Explore using AI models to automate bidding on online job platforms based on skill sets and requirements - WATCH\n\n@25:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou are on mute, sorry, marketing is not the question you need to know, we are here jobs like in AI, like constantly getting the marketing, this is also the question.\n\n@25:14 - Malkeet Singh\nMarketing side obviously, like business team is the hard or bind of the company, so definitely like using AI, I will try to explore like what are the options available in the market because we are doing the business online, we are using online platform in order to get the business.\nSo I guess here maybe I can prepare a model using AI which will help me and which will connect with different, you know, business platforms, that model will help me in order to work.\nto you know bid as a as a as a first person on the job as per our skills to one of business side I will say Kia we can use and definitely I would love to use that AI to Jesse Manimullar KmVision online platform we use Gartan business learning to push my way up KMA4E as a model Kijo model may platform use Gartan to use a connectable or based on this online bid room who bidding or who who who may help me as a first person Pani as a inner line he must say for a go checker job description who gave as per my requirement as per my skill set or suitable help for me or\nYeah, I mean the price criteria, the location. Basically, the automation is available.\n\n@27:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe manager has manually developed for all the ways that the user thinks of this. Yeah. Yeah, for business to use it, use it.\n\n@27:13 - Malkeet Singh\nYeah.\n\n@27:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPerfect. Perfect. Makes sense. Now, towards the high side, you have to be able to reach a new future, but a bit like the huge part.\nYou have to be to do Okay.\n\n@27:46 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, I guess, lack of So, will be a little hard, you know, to generalize the things in the team.\nSo, I guess, skills we have, so we need to find a way, Kaseyam, Joe Murray Management, Yamarijo Tech leaders within our company, how we can, you know, skill up the technology for them.\nAnd then we can go in the market and hire the other 12%. You know, for we can train our existing developers, can hire fresher and train them.\nWe can provide the training sessions for one of the experts, you know, available in the market. So, challenge is a skill as of now.\nI still have a main problem.\n\n@29:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat do you about about your success? What do you think What do think your success? think about success? What you think success?\nWhat do you think your success? What do think success? do think What do you success to do?\n\n@29:36 - Malkeet Singh\nWhat think about your success? do think about What do you think success? think tutors visioners. teachingNow a major field called may be\nOne V got 10 days. Now using generative AI tool, it could be done within one day. So, one day or two days, next.\nSo, including test cases and all. So, we must take a few times here, or 10 times more productive, and using generative AI in terms of development.\n\n@30:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's very good, or in terms of marketing and other activities.\n\n@30:33 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, in marketing, I must say... don't have questions or words? don't know. are you doing? you doing file or maybe .org is having 700 pages.\nSo, in that case, we can use online platform to go back up there. Joeski, Iq, Continuity, Iq, Joeski, Joeski, Iq, Iq, mostThirudiptan and some pandemic.\nlet wahs be down here. 2 hours. But AI may be still from big data reader name or escape. Why would you agree that you are here not be today but you are always here?\n\n@32:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm going to door I should be there for I can't find anyone waiting What else are for? These two have So, I to make need.\n\n@32:32 - Malkeet Singh\nSee, I'm not sure as of now, I'm not telling you my experience, but I have seen or I have face using AI models as of now.\nI can run each other, one team may be bored of the array, or data the array to update it specific.\nYeah. If correct, insert the enemy to the head, it is not providing what I'm looking for. So, that kind of thing.\n\n@33:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nof you know stuff but basically context window you have to go through the batch around that but you can text to do the thing which will be after that right what I yeah I mean as per my experience that's that's valid on the other here but even context window be over here but as the context window expands it will become very difficult to answer questions within that range coming into starting me and middle me and then it starts radiating yeah that's right that works out well anything else that you mean here you have a lot of understanding understanding general yeah what a relation I am with you after you've been that okay when something that I understood something that I decided for it yeah yeah I say achieve it with the I said which very achieve here in terms of regard it yeah that's it for example keep watch our elevation drop type key but you can text window that you can\nand it is to dig in the children that are under it. Which is good. What else? Which one has a queen inside of it?\n\n@34:08 - Malkeet Singh\nAs such, I guess, I don't know what has, So, AI is everywhere. Nowadays, without AI, is difficult to manage.\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\n@34:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nvery difficult to manage. manage. difficult to manage. It is very to manage. It to manage.\n\n@34:58 - Malkeet Singh\nIt is very difficult manage. So, I want a very good understanding of coding structures, okay, so I was a developer to sub-sepilemira target.\nWe right now, we are using AI models, AI third-party APIs. But to back-end, we have structured how to go, that kind of stuff I would like to export.\nAnd even after one year, like a few other mechanics, I have to say AI is a certified solution architect.\nor I must have, you know, the good understanding of models, like how it works. Obviously, on a business side, like, business side explore, that they have a happy, helpful behavior, you know, can be problem hands to cases or help customers in using AI tools.\nthat kind of thing is, as per my industry, I'm going make some sense. I'm sure it's going to very important.\n\n@37:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOr, how can you question your mobile AI, a budget of video ops, or do you want give me AI use, or a digital transformation of this kind of model?\nAny recommendation to opt-in? We can risk it.\n\n@37:54 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, I guess I have to say I have say I have say have to that You know, we pick on the stream nowadays, we're seeing beta, beta, unemployment side, to be honest.\nOkay, I'm going to change more and more, you know, employment opportunities, great, great. I guess, out of 190 percent, 90 percent, you know, community who depends on the jobs.\nBut not all, you know, not all are in the IT, but they are in every, in every industry. So, using AI, I would recommend to all companies like IT companies.\nWhat do you say, we know, there are different types of industry, textiles, maybe, chemical industry they have, farm industry they have, to foster industry and what they are doing, know, most of work manually and there are a lot of opportunity for the IT companies where we can help them in order to make the automations using AI tools, you know we can help them in their production lines I guess using AI.\nSo AI also robotics, you know, that kind of stuff. I guess for what opportunity they have, IT company, but on top of it, we need to take care of employment as well.\nACTION ITEM: Explore using AI and robotics to automate processes and create employment opportunities at other non-IT companies - WATCH\n\n@39:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's a very good part to be both, which is this direction, and a lot of people in terms of business would want to see a cost or get more efficient than stuff, right?\n\n@39:59 - Malkeet Singh\nSo basically, If you don't mind, I also wanted to ask one question to you, like in terms of AI, what do you think like AI, Aniwaletai main, Job, Kaiya, yeah, industry?\n\n@40:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNot in IT, I guess I think it's first thing to So, you need to do this, you need to upskill, you need to move up Kaiya, you need to do this.\nThat's why people pay you, right? And after I'm AI, I totally can't do this, that's why need to do Which means, AI is the right tool.\nSo, we are going to decide, you broadcast click on example, if they are in charge of using a JSON and the status of they are to It's it's not static.\nSo,-gum,-gum,-gum,-gum,-gum, i-e-gum, is So, who is to do is to my empire, go job type, job AI, make a new factor, make easy job behind.\nI mean, factor on a kisana, that's that's my way of looking at it, maybe, maybe Maybe 50 percent.\n\n@42:00 - Malkeet Singh\nSir, I missed out on the answer to you as well.\n\n@42:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, depending on your type, will be coming up in part half, what I can say. Like other content, right, tricky, path proof, content, right.\nLet's say it is a compromise.\n\n@42:19 - Malkeet Singh\nTen people say right now they are managing with one feature.\n\n@42:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, but if you look at it multiple in a different way is, you would have ten people, ten people, nine people were writing something and then somebody had to validate it or hadn't looked at it.\nSo, out of those ten, probably one was the person who was able to check the work being done. He was supposed to be the manager, right, or was supposed to look at these things.\nSecond, content generation you have not yet. In terms of only content in the books, the IC is generated. IC is content here.\nyou cannot let it go through. Unless it until one expert checks it correctly, I push the name, because still it is not achieved.\nthe number of people, number of people, because of quantity of business and not because of people had to reach out out.\nexample, Ajmeh, let us say, like Shithika example, is principle later. Ajmeh, Iqbila, Kiti, may, come and accept out, they can in over a kit, only parts of over a kit, much bigger So it is not a matter of medical room in the car, but it is a matter of the business.\nbasic town. All people who are in the car are the car, they are in car. they are the car.\nSo, it's about increasing your capacity as a company, so what do you want to do in but it's big thing.\n\n@44:55 - Malkeet Singh\nIt's thing.\n\n@44:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what is a big thing? is So, I wanted to take a break to give India money, all right, please give me to visit the US, right, I am trying to understand here we are going have have in the public and to see that one of the reasons of this exercise, right.\nSo, that we can take a layer of the idea, and then change up the information to make sure.\nACTION ITEM: Develop a big picture strategy for how the company can leverage AI - WATCH\n\n@45:22 - Malkeet Singh\nSo, we have a, let's say, Mario IIT group. May I? So, we remember, it's a big approach, cut the area, guess.\nIt's a big approach, Roman.\n\n@45:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's a big approach, strategy, it's a It's a big strategy, it's a big strategy.\n\n@45:40 - Malkeet Singh\nIt's strategy, Maybe So, I think that completions, are you just saying to me, And mainly, there are a lot of people in our group as well, Pushtanthene, UIT, companies, had government, not.\nSo what do you think? you pick up perspective app? Copy, push? Common track, we have...\n\n@46:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think some other-elect names, we're here many more We do more multiple models. Understandable. It's little simpler. one, marketing...\nOr content of number 10. What we're to now... it's because it's more than animation. It is able to reducile of coverage.\nable to get things done. variation so that's one part. Second part development made has been able to say around 20% time for most people.\nWe can develop and we have to reduce over it. Third strategy became the army army after understanding the logic capabilities of the AI.\nIt's saying equally come to this if the AI has tried it. So they want the first employee gen AI kind of a approach.\nRight thing, but then they go So, there are many different types of research tools. this case, are many different types of research tools.\nSo, are many different types research order help with I will go ahead and that. But I have around 200 people, so let's see.\n\n@47:30 - Malkeet Singh\nSo basically, sub-key goals can be using AI quality.\n\n@47:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSub-key goals are like a monkey, like an 18-year-old. Everybody wants to be more efficient and save time. And money.\nAll right. the menu, etc. All right. Thank you so much for your time there again. This is a great day.\nThank you so much for your time. you so much for your time.

        "content": "Transcript\nsharlton - April 02\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 53 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:02 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay, I don't know you, just a second we can call, you can see can I call you after 10 minutes, I'll just need to call it, yeah, I'll be there, okay, so it's taking time to load.\nHi, sorry, I'm back with you, sorry, I just had to take the call. No worries, Sheldon, worries at all.\n\n@0:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFirst of all, thank you guys, thank you for taking this. I'll give you a very short background and then I'll give you what exactly we are connecting for, okay.\nSo, about 7 years in technology, about last 20 years mostly in senior management, handling right from, let's say, poor to- I have access to this.\nSorry, Billen, you broke\n\n@1:03 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay, I have some bandwidth issues but I will just off my video hope that is okay with you. That is absolutely fine with it, no worries on that.\nOkay, perfect.\n\n@1:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, yeah, I was saying 27 years in technology, few years mostly in senior management, still has on coder, strategy, whatnot.\nYou guys are already aware you guys are doing a day in the layout. So, that's a very short profile.\nThis particular session is about Gen AI. We have AI as a largest stack. We have, let's say machine learning inside AI, a smaller part of AI.\nWe have deep learning, smaller part of machine learning and then we have generative AI, right? And generative AI has boom today like anything.\nSo, the The discussion today is mostly around the fact that everybody is talking about January, every board, every CEO, every CTO, every employee is talking about January, but on the ground, what is the ROI that we are getting out of January, that's one part, how beneficial it is, is another part, are we able to see concrete benefits, on-ground benefits is the is the next effort.\nSo I bring the interview into three parts, first part will be basic data for you and the company that will give me an idea on where exactly place what we are capturing, the second part will be on-ground truth, the ROI is the reality of things, the measurable reality of things that you are seeing on your troughs, what kind of things you are able to see, which is giving some tangible benefit, and the third part\ninterview would be mostly around your opinions on what you have said so far and what do you envision in the future.\nDoes that sound okay? Was I able to sum it up?\n\n@3:11 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nSo you're trying to extract the data based on our business workloads.\n\n@3:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, not exactly a business workflow, but whatever you are doing in your organization at various levels, it might be a product level, it might be HR, might be marketing.\nYeah, various departments.\n\n@3:29 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAbsolutely. Every department of our companies. Absolutely.\n\n@3:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbasically based out of that, what is the tangible takeaway that somebody can have? Who is trying to go the January around?\nOkay. And this is why we are only specifically narrowing down things to January. Does it make sense? So to begin with what industry and sector would we count ourselves and our experience from in this interview?\n\n@4:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nyou're asking industry we belong to is it yeah the experience that you're sharing what what industry are you bringing it from so mostly its security from what I see is that is that correct yeah within security there are a lot of things right so what sector in within the industry so we call it as application security okay yeah so we have experience which is gathered from conducting application security assessments right one of the assessment or applications again imagine you are a coder imagine you you develop a code for a particular application and then you give it to a it could be for a product or an application you want to know how secure that application is because you might have introduced some errors into that code which could lead to so I understand abjecting and building\n\n@5:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI've been doing that for a very long time you've been doing it are you just only on app security and ability or do we have an extended portfolio that goes beyond that yes we started so our experience is that but then when we started our company we we we had a footprints on and other areas as well cloud security network depths of cops right and grc conflicts and compliances and auditing with respect to risk management so regarding piece thing very nice yeah great and what what would be the size of the company right now with it i mean in terms of employees and revenue and at any point in the interview you can say okay i want to share this data or you can say again i i'm sharing this data for the sake of context but this data will not should not be quoted so both options you can use at any point in the interview\n\n@6:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAnd I would recommend the given also to jump in as in when required. So, for this question, 30 plus So 30 plus in each lawyer?\n\n@6:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, like revenue started already or what's the status? What is that? The revenue, the annual revenue roughly. Yeah, so I can answer.\n\n@6:20 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYes, ma'am.\n\n@6:22 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYes, so we are in bootstrap and from the day one, not day one. So we are bootstrap and we started making revenue from the very first year.\n\n@6:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nVery nice. So, we are in the beginning, we started making money.\n\n@6:38 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAnd what I put you in like, it's like few million, few billion, but where do we put it? Okay, so we are yet to become a million dollar business.\n\n@6:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMaybe soon, not a million, you can, yeah.\n\n@6:56 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nHow can we understand that? Yeah, yes, yes.\n\n@7:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAwesome, so, and 30 plus size in terms of employees, right? Perfect, awesome. So, in terms of AI adoption, and when we say adoption, we again are narrowing down assets to gen AI.\nHow would you place yourself? So, let's add from, let's say, product, right? In terms of your product, are you using gen AI product development, just a couple of months back.\n\n@7:33 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nBut then, for now, we are not including any gen AI within that product, but all this while we've been into service industry, and our core trial is getting into, you know, not at the automated level, but manual level, how a would do.\nHacker will not sit in exploit things in the tool level, but then he will have his own way\n\n@8:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nand scope option within the product portfolio right or the service portfolio you are saying yes right okay and in terms of let us say sales or marketing right when you reach out to customers Jenny is an awesome tool there right that's like one of the core things that any company which is reaching out today is using using their in terms of marketing sales marketing and sales yeah Bivin you want to answer that and that can be a bivin that can be as simple as a charge GPT or an image generation can be as simple as that to complicated stuff your choice so yeah we use we use LinkedIn as one of our major platforms to generate in and of course yeah we make use of tools like Canvas and all that which is kind of a related tools right so those I'm sorry\n\n@9:00 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAny? Actually, yes.\n\n@9:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCanva has genii features. Yeah, yeah.\n\n@9:04 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nwe use to some extent for our marketing material use that. Okay.\n\n@9:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd lead tracking or let's say automated getbacks, et cetera. You're not using any part of that right now. Right?\nNo, we use Zoho product.\n\n@9:21 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nZoho products.\n\n@9:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo Zoho has, I don't think Zoho has a very strong integration with genii. think then plug it in separately.\n\n@9:29 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nDoes it have? I don't know.\n\n@9:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI might be missing in there.\n\n@9:33 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nIt doesn't. They are, they are into it. Okay.\n\n@9:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah. I mean, I remember for a client of mine, I got Zoho products integrated with something called many chats.\n\n@9:46 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nRight?\n\n@9:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt was easy to get that integration done because the API was offered. So we could easily pull and push data.\n\n@9:52 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nWhat is that? Mini?\n\n@9:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMini chat. M-A-N-Y-C-H-A-T-S. It will allow you to create genii workflows so that you can manage your customer. and you can push it to your ERP or CRM and then back again.\nYeah, open source thing. No, this is a paid service. I see that customer was mostly in media and they wanted to manage their leads basically.\nYeah, so great. And this is like your power to service part because the marketing sales part support is another idea where Jenny is doing great, especially in L1 segment, right?\nSo do you use Jenny in support for things there are? Not really.\n\n@10:36 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAgain, chat, GPT and things come into the picture. Out of validation of issues and other stuff. Okay.\n\n@10:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo automated workflow or agent or anything there? No.\n\n@10:46 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nGreat.\n\n@10:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in terms of generating feedback back to a customer, we still use Jenny and we promote usage of and I have just run it through it and then give a good answer to your customer or yes, no, no, no, no,\n\n@11:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYes, yes.\n\n@11:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAwesome. And in terms of HR or within company, know that theme sizes are not very vast right now that it becomes very difficult to maintain, but yeah, I mean, let us say policy such as another aspect of things I mean, do we use any engineer there in the HR segment.\nSo, it's like the end of the rechargeivity dark.\n\n@11:23 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay. Sorry. Grok. Sometimes I'm mispronounced that.\n\n@11:32 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nThere are so many these there.\n\n@11:38 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOne is open source.\n\n@11:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ncan even confuse the two of them. That's true.\n\n@11:45 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYeah.\n\n@11:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, yeah, this is great. This is a good start for me to get a basic layout, the layout of the land.\nNow, if you talk specifically, right? Okay.\n\n@11:57 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAll right.\n\n@12:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nservice, the place where we are in. A lot of Genii is used in anomaly detection because we don't have structured data, right?\nA lot of times, I mean, sometimes the logs are great, right? Sometimes the metrics are awesome. I can actually run ML on it easily and I can play around with it.\nBut there are times when this is so messed up that it's really difficult to first, let's say massage the data, get it on.\nSo, Genii does a great job at taking up an understandable data in terms of structure and then getting into a structure and then balancing it out.\nwe using some sort of that or even as low runs as massaging data or other aspects thereof? Kind of partially, yeah.\n\n@12:49 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay.\n\n@12:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd how is your success rate or your understanding of ROI? mean, is it doing something good for you? it just wasted?\n\n@13:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nIt saves the time, instead of, I sit and think and do it, it saves the time, is what I would say.\n\n@13:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, and what one term of time would you say it saves in terms of data massaging? Half a day to one hour.\nI used to spend half a day, but then now... percentage, that would be like 20%, right, or 25%, like four hours to one hour roughly, that's a ratio.\nperfect, perfect, that makes sense. And other than data massaging, there are a lot of times when we use it in terms of code that we want to generate, right?\nI'm going to kill a small snippet of code, right, will go and create it. Let's just ask strategy between giving me a function or something that I can use.\nOr I can use something like, let's say, code whisperer or let's say, co-pilot from GitHub, right, to generate code faster.\nI'm using something of that sort.\n\n@13:54 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI don't think so. I don't so.\n\n@13:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nabsolutely perfect. Especially... the security, it's a sensitive matter there, and then in terms of brainstorming. So, a lot of times when there's a hassle or there's a incident that has come up or there's a possibility of an incident that I'm able to notice, right?\nA lot of things what they do is they try to brainstorm with intelligent bots like that GPT or let's say do others that I know of and they try to reason it out and they try to see it from other angles which they might have missed out, right?\nWhich might operate from session with the AI. Is there something that we have been trying that on record? Of course we do.\n\n@14:38 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay and how does it on ground in reality in terms of it does help in terms of you know we're not completely relying on yeah we refer it but then when we talk to customers when we put it in the document or over the email or whatever it is it does help.\n\n@15:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo is it framing or is it helping in terms of brainstorming See, once a brainstorming is done, we have to put it in the papers, right?\n\n@15:09 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nRight, so it is helping in both your same.\n\n@15:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd what kind of what kind of help does it do? Does it again like 25% of time it saves or how does it help you?\nLike I mentioned half a day to one number, right? So again, 25% saving in terms of brainstorming and streaming or both together?\nBoth together. Okay, 25% time, great. I will go a bit deeper into it, but before that, me, let me phrase this out.\na lot of times, I mean, I call this guy as very educated child, right? Because it might very confidently give you data that is like and bull altogether makes no sense, right?\nAnd then with this brainstorming, of dreaming we actually have to very deeply go through it and then probably revert and correct and that cycle sometimes takes time and dilute the ROI do you feel the same or do you feel no 25% of time I'm saving it depends on how smartly you call okay this data is enough for me okay let me live with this let me take a risk of this particular data at least you keep the prompting and then it keeps giving you data I don't say I have my own limit to stop and referring and then I put my own brain at some extent and then I are losing waste time there that's awesome so I have my own limitation it's not happy person then I rely on this so what I do that is counting what kind of time do we think it seems that again 25% is the is there like number nine progress yes great now when we say 25% time that's not ROI right that's basically oh it's saving me time it's saving\nwas probably a dozen times. Not overall, if I do a very...\n\n@17:03 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI can concentrate. See, if I'm half a day, one hour, right? Imagine from from 10.30 to 12.30, I'm supposed to create a proposal.\nI'm supposed to talk about something to someone, right? it's Google, I go. It's Google is like an ocean, right?\ngives me a lot of materials. get dripped a wish. And then now it becomes rubbish, but at the of the day, we go Google.\nNow it is used only for Google Map direction, which is what it is. then, if it's an activity that's focused data that I'm looking at, it is not drifting me.\nIf I'm able to finish my work, usually I take at least two to three hours studying about one particular subject before I talk to the customer.\nBut then now it is a matter of even over the course also I get to know what they're into, because chargeability gives me a layman level of understanding on what is\nThat gives me over the call also I'll be able to talk. Otherwise I'll tell I'll get back to you.\nI need to understand better on this. I go waste my time Google 4 hours and then I try to write something on the email.\nSo it is generally this is this is on the go helping me every time.\n\n@18:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight and number you said is 25% time but I was interested in the fact that end of the day everything boils down to money right the return on investment that we are planning to have.\nSo in terms of return on investment do you think that this 25% time that we are saving is actually going to something more productive and getting you better.\n\n@18:39 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI don't I'm not looking for a one person who sit and do all this purpose and I myself will do it from the leadership level.\n\n@18:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you are basically saving the salary of one person.\n\n@18:50 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nIf he sales guy, I've been a real guy in the past working with companies like IBM, Synops and all of it.\nI don't want to recruit someone. this is helping me in just matter of 15-20 minutes. Right.\n\n@19:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it is saving you one person in terms of pre-save, right? Right.\n\n@19:08 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nThat's one of the skill that we will get from pre-sales, Sitting and adopting the proposal. I'm saving that. Okay.\n\n@19:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo in general, if I talk about ROI in a very rough manner in receiving, the salary of one person who is basically going to come up as a pre-sales guy and help you out.\nYou're just getting that off, right? Yeah, because mostly I'm doing it.\n\n@19:34 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. No, no, correct.\n\n@19:38 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nWe're giving it actual data.\n\n@19:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo, that makes a lot of sense. Now, in terms of marketing sales, and again, I think you will be taking this out.\nSo in terms of marketing sales, right? mean, I remember two years back, we wrote a program that basically went into LinkedIn and looked at all the resumes and then it could score those resumes.\ncould give me a score and then build out and tell me, hey, these are the top five guys you should talk to, right?\nI mean, have we developed something like this or are we still using the generic genii tools that we have or camera tools or lower tools which they are giving or I mean, are we taking a step ahead towards this?\n\n@20:18 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYou mean to say this is what the recruitment signed you are asking or later? For now marketing sales, I was just giving an example of what we did in LinkedIn but in terms of marketing and sales So, still to some extent we are following the old school method only we have not used extensively on any of the genii tools because others is more of a service.\nfor example, our business model works in a manner where I get a project I need to do one resource.\nIf you are a product company then probably I will look at a way to stage that and I need lots and lots of leads to close the business kind of here.\nEvery new business I do bring in, I need to add resources, so very cautiously we do that hand-in-hand, so we don't go aggressively through 100 loops, try to close at a time also, so we are not using any 3i tools as of now, with reference, with the regular old school methodology we are going.\n\n@21:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so these resources are more like consulting resources which somebody can connect with and give things down and right on this.\n\n@21:29 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay, so in terms of the resource, whatever we have mentioned is in-house we have, that is our full-time employees but in case of there is a scale in the new business coming, we have a business model called a training, so in that we have a pool of resources whom we have trained and readily available and if at all based on their availability we hire them on the hand and try to fulfill and this is what is required, we recruit them as a full-timer and we continue to deploy.\nAwesome. Awesome.\n\n@22:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo this tool is interesting and I mean I, from what I understand again, I have seen from other company interviews is that, yeah, to build my tool, I have to get somebody to get them up to mark in terms of learning and then testing them.\nAnd I use Giniai tools to make sure that they learn well and the Giniai tool also tests them so that when it comes of the right time, it automatically is able to handle that across.\nIs that something you're doing?\n\n@22:28 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nSo on training, yeah, training for Charlton handles that it's more of a technical site. But to answer this, the pool of resources, we are just trying to follow the Zoho home, they have under it, like try to bring in resources from the remote locations, give them an opportunity because there is no sort of talent in terms of people from the remote places, but just that need to be identified.\nSo we run training program or webinar across tire to type three colleges in across the country, where we offer our demo, we make it as a small training program, we bring them together, then Charlton takes a train of training them, make them ready to run and from there we take it up.\nSo, in terms of 30 resource whatever we have in house, in that 90% of the resource joined as an intern, say 3 to 4 years back and successfully our attrition rate is also quite low because these people understand the importance of being honest for the people, whoever has given the opportunity, they've worked with us and the completed successfully, second year, third year, are resources up to fourth year, they have completed and there it is.\nSo, terms of using the gen A tools for the training Charlton probably you can highlight if currently we are not doing anything.\n\n@23:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, all three segments of this pool management identify training and evaluate, they are good use cases for gen A and but we are currently not using it.\n\n@24:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nPerfect. No.\n\n@24:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, the other part was support now. We talked about support and we use chat GPU to, let's say, give answers on specific questions, but there would be a lot of generic questions which would come in, right?\nlot of support questions are like things that you really don't need to escape and even to an L2. then L1 can answer by looking at the data or some kind of a result and answer back.\nSo, are we automating that using GNAI or not yet on that aspect?\n\n@24:29 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nNo, we haven't.\n\n@24:32 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nNothing is automated as it to make it very simple. Got it.\n\n@24:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIn terms of HR learn, again trying to bring down to HR? HR, oh-ho only we use. You are great.\nthis is what specifically we were doing, but do you think that some of these are a part of your strategic goal in terms of, I mean, it will affect your business ROI, right?\nNot just in care, there is something, I have, GNAI. and we should pick it up and we should work with that, which is the general audience of the world right now, but specifically, you have anything mind which you say, hey, these things if I pick up, it's going to really affect my bottom line, bottom line.\n\n@25:15 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nCurrently, we have thought about it because we are in the industry where our, see, our bread and butter comes from the APD, but other side, cloud security and network, we use tools, right?\nMore than automation, we live with manual approach, right? Though we use related tools, but currently, see, we are not a product that is completed.\nWe have a product that is being developed, currently, maybe after six months, we can think of how to incorporate AI into the process.\nWith sales, pre-sales, yes, we do, we do use strategy, strategy and other stuff. but not on the other side, other departments.\n\n@26:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, so even with service, right, the way that it helps is that one resource, which was earlier handling, let's say two customers, if we are using January the right way, it should be able to have, let's say four customers, right, those aspects, if they're a part of the strategy that works on those aspects yet, only it's too raw for right now, we don't want to focus on it, let it mature, mature, let it Okay, and again in terms of other things that we discussed like in terms of marketing, sales or support, that we have in our goals and that will help our company in any way, or the top line.\n\n@26:45 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI'm not sure about now here. Great, that's helpful.\n\n@26:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow in terms of achievement, what we will try to do, this is a last segment of numbers and then we will go to premium.\nSo, in terms of numbers, think most of January that you are using is probably charge GPT and that also in terms of brainstorming and I mean, framing stuff in terms of data massaging at times and you said around 25% of time it saves you, it saves you a 3 sales diet, right.\nThat was for brainstorming and framing, but for data massaging, what does it save you? Does it save you? I mean, one resource which you assigned to somebody does it save you life, one resource can handle much more, but what's the ROI there?\n\n@27:36 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nAnd I see one 3 sales guy, let's say monthly at 20,000 rupees.\n\n@27:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEven data massaging, I mean, data massaging probably will be done by a pool team, right. That I am only doing it, I am not only not doing the technical people there.\n\n@27:57 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay, okay, all right. it in my way and I and drive it to my way when it is tested or accessed.\n\n@28:04 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\ngot it something, got it, make sense.\n\n@28:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat, so I think I have a basic understanding of how this works out. Now, in your future plan, in your company future plans or let us say one year down the line or let us say some definitive period down the line, are there some things that you are planning to incorporate within your system or you are saying, hey, it is too hard right now, I do not want to look at it and that is a good answer also.\n\n@28:32 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nSo, maybe I can, yeah, I will add to that. So, right now we are not looking at it, but in after being in the industry for five years, we slowly started realizing that if being in a service, it helps us to grow, but at the same time to scale it multiple x volt, we need to have a product in-house.\nSo, apparently we are started working on a developing tool as well. So, maybe once we have that in place, probably we might use whatever the answers we said no currently.\nWe might try to incorporate all those Gen H tools, generating leads and promotion of that we'll use it. currently to answer you, say in next six months, probably things can change and it might start using more of the way Gen A tools.\nGet the point. Get the point.\n\n@29:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd this is this is exactly why I'm doing this. This is like size of meeting some or two hundred people.\nIt's because I see that the industry is like gather about this, but on the ground, I mean if you want to do it, you would also want to see, hey, what are others doing?\nWhat have they benefited from on ground, right? I mean, other than just jumping on the bandwagon and trying out 10 different things, is there a way that I can understand, these two things really work well.\n\n@29:54 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nRight.\n\n@29:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, that's the idea of collecting all this information from everybody and trying to collate it in one place. Awesome, now I'm going to go down to a segment that I would love to have opinions from you guys, right?\nNow, today if you see that, hey, I've been great in my life, I think this is, I mean, we have realized that this might be helpful, but we are not trying it out yet, right?\nBut in some time, we would love to try it out, or we are trying to do a product around it.\nWhat do you think is the hardest hurdle to get on this panel? Is it, is it, hey, the technology is not well tested out?\nwhat, what is your opinion and your industry? Is the hardest hurdle to get on our general AI solutions for yourself?\n\n@30:47 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nHey, I don't know what to say. And this is, this is absolutely opinion.\n\n@30:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, you need to give me a hard number or two. don't know what to put it in a funny manner.\n\n@30:59 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nPlease get targeted. I don't think that's going be The sales target, wheat humans, mind it.\n\n@31:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOK, so I mean, if I understand it correctly, you're saying that there is no way in which, I mean, most important piece being getting my customers onboarded, it is able to get my customers onboarded.\nIs that what you are putting on?\n\n@31:26 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nHow do you gauge a customer whether he will buy a particular solution to us or not? In the sales process itself, right?\nRight. At times, you know, imagine you go for a big company like Resubang when you are anyone. They have a criteria on how they choose vendors.\nThat's right. But we are working in an industry that we don't know how they choose vendors. more we probe, yes, we will still get data, but we are not on that.\nI don't think we will take this on that.\n\n@31:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, right, right.\n\n@32:00 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nRight now you are hard as sure.\n\n@32:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet's say here I don't see a use case that's what I help me on. Is that is that why we are putting it on?\n\n@32:07 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYes. Great.\n\n@32:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's a good answer.\n\n@32:11 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nGreat.\n\n@32:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow we have not been using Genia much but we have been using it in bits and pieces in different places that you shared.\nWhat do you think has been the most notable thing that it has been able to do for either of you?\ntypically when you can answer separately and you can answer separately, but in your sense in your understanding, hey this is the biggest benefit it has given to me.\nAll this rule of love has given me this one benefit.\n\n@32:40 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay. So, if I understand your question correctly, you are asking what is the benefit that I have because of using the adopting?\n\n@32:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe most notable benefit that you would say, this is the biggest benefit I got from in Genia and so far.\n\n@32:56 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nOkay. Let me conclude, Charlton, if you have answered it in\n\n@33:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nNow on a daily basis I'm getting it, see like I mentioned right, see every day is a new learning for us.\nI do learn things. The biggest help is I'm able to win deals with the help of charge equity. I'm helping the same team to win their targets right and if I turn back and see last year we were able to win a lot of deals where we were able to accomplish new business, new areas, new services.\nObviously, Sadhgipity has helped us. Got it.\n\n@33:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, basically in the ring and brainstorming would be one of the strongest that you would say right?\n\n@33:46 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYes.\n\n@33:47 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nGreat. You were saying something?\n\n@33:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes.\n\n@33:51 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nto add, add little more to whatever short. To add whatever short one has mentioned. For example, before the January 100,\nNow, Google is a source where it is true, for example, if there is an inquiry about the X service, we are depending on Google, we are going to search for it, then we need to read through that, then we need to reframe those sentence to the required manner and also we need to authenticate whether it is right or wrong, so many things were there.\nNow, blindly, so for me, I blindly trusting the chat GPT, if there is somebody's going and asking for a service, what we don't even offer, but something related to that, immediately go to chat GPT, are asking them to prepare a proposal itself and give it to me or what are the outcomes that I'm looking for this particular requirement, immediately they prepare it, we were able to give the data on a much faster pace, that is what Falcon was telling, it helps us to work on a on a faster pace, plus known it for the validation because we plus that it gives the best details and we go ahead\nwith our customers to fulfill by submitting a proposal at cost-to-face. So that really helps us to use the business to create tool.\n\n@35:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbasically, framing and summarizing becomes really, really, very easy, is what you're saying in your understanding, right?\n\n@35:16 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nPerfect.\n\n@35:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou should also try this one, City. Public City is doing a great job in terms of research. so, I mean, OpenAI also came up with the research too.\nBut Public City is still doing better job at that. So if you want to talk about how do I spell it?\n\n@35:36 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYou?\n\n@35:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPublic City, P, R, P, L, E, X, I, T, Y. You should have a free option, so you can try that out.\nOK.\n\n@35:45 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI'm sure the shelter must be using, but I'm heard of it. Yeah, I've heard about this.\n\n@35:51 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nMostly, I use Grok and JADGBT only.\n\n@35:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou don't have to do that as well. And that's why I realized in terms of finding things. Google plus LMM, so search plus summarization.\nThat's that's especially okay. All right, now we'll go a bit more interesting in these opinion questions. There's like in in your opinion, what is the biggest revelation you feel so far here?\nRight? this is something I certainly felt, oh, this is this is something different, something. What do you feel that Jenny I in your organization?\nHas there been a bit of revelation? Has there been a difference? One is, I don't need people to sit down, summarize, or I don't need experts to sit down and tell me what customer is doing here.\nAnd there's a specialty area. I can actually do those things with Jenny. That's one thing I understand, right?\n\n@36:53 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI see, I keep repeating if you if you ask the same question, it helps me on the breeze. I'm trying to get it in different ways, I'm trying to get to the point from the same answer.\nBecause you're asking the same person, the idea of question is the way the words being used is different but it's the same for me, I would say the same thing.\n\n@37:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, but the idea is basically to try and job your memory and your thoughts in different ways so that we can capture the exact data and then we can represent that.\n\n@37:30 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI'm not juggle around, I'm being focused on the answer because that is one area where I'm getting benefited, I keep repeating the same.\nI understand.\n\n@37:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I'm going to turn around this question again in a very different way. Again, it will be probably the same answer but you have to give me afterwards.\nIf you have a chance of knowing what you know today about January, right?\n\n@37:53 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nIf you have what, can you come again please?\n\n@37:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou know about January, what you know today, you know that, right? But you have a chance to go one year back.\nOkay. Now, what would you do differently in this one year? I would have wasted time with Google. Google will not be happy hearing that.\nSo basically, you would have used jedi for research mode, right?\n\n@38:24 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYeah, it's focus research. That's what I would say. Even that is also the value that now you are saying perplexity, right?\nAgain, it is like Google. Should I go with this? Go with this? Now, see, I started with the activity, but now I go to copilot, I go to, I compare four or five things now.\nIt's also kind of getting to the old style, which I used to follow, but I have my own limits.\nI should solve at one point in 10, get the thing and then go ahead, right? the best part is it gives the frame what you look for.\nGoogle is not like that. The way how we prompt, it could be a picture or it could be a template that you want to put it in the proposal.\nEverything, it replicates what you think. Yes, it does.\n\n@39:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd moreover, the recent image of it that has come a few days back, three days back. The giveaway. Now those images, the red that came a few days back is actually able to give you text in the image properly as well.\nEarlier text used to be jumbled up, right? Yes. Now you have awesome text that you can get out of chat GPT.\nThere is three days back, think. It's doing a great job at text now, my image generation. And it's coming to the activity window, so you can try it out.\n\n@39:44 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nWe are living in three edition, only we are not giving any. should come to three edition very soon as well.\nI think it might have already come in. Yeah, okay.\n\n@39:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, now my last question and this question again, I'm going Partly you have answered. Wait, wait, wait, wait, didn't get your answer on this one.\nIf you had a chance to go one year back, you do the same thing as Chardon? Use, I mean, less Google and do more research on other tools, the area I do or anything else you have in mind.\nExactly.\n\n@40:16 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nSame thing like whatever Chardon and said. Yeah. Awesome. I'd like to do this. Awesome. So, here is the last question.\n\n@40:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nquestion is, if somebody who is starting to work on JNI and starting to explore now is coming to you and asking you, hey, I mean, what do you think I should do or not do when using a JNI tool?\nWhat would be your recommendation to them? They are the top three things that you should do, they are the top three things that you should not do.\nThat's a good question. Don't put your data there.\n\n@40:56 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nToo much of data. example you do not that becomes a plagiarism yeah already we are doing place someone has put in and then that is facing the data from there and we need to see how we can risk copy-pasting our things there and when you ask the AI to massage your data make sure you put you do not hello or you do not put in the sensitive data of your company proprietary IP or whatever it is or use a local lm for that purpose if so required right exactly that I need to develop on my own also so data protection is one that you say hey be careful about this what else to be for about that's one thing I can think of but I don't know what else okay do you want anything you have in mind sorry\n\n@42:00 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nI'm not getting anything you have in your mind do not do this your advice to somebody don't come coming on to the gen air and I'll say one way I look at this is I know this tools are very much near but another day doing business there are some certain business where it's an independent without using genics or something with a human touch all that only happens so we can how much ever we use of this tool it's like a certain action it can help but still human touch it's always different so so let let's not let let don't don't miss out the human thing don't depend more on this take advantage of whatever the things are available but use that for humans something like what I can think of awesome so if I would put it in the way I understood it it is keep a human layer on top of the AI don't just let the air do things\n\n@43:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust keep an even layer on top of it, is that correct?\n\n@43:02 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nCorrect, I was running short of words, you framed it very nicely, thank you. Awesome, more very good.\n\n@43:09 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nThank you. Made him answer and for his own question.\n\n@43:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd what do you put up as do, these are don't do, don't have a, I mean, you should have a data protection layer, don't just give it data, you should have a human layer, not just follow it, but what should you do, other top two, three things, you should go do this.\nWhat would be your advice? Yeah, I told him answer, a data protection is one. What would you say, hey, this you should definitely go try and, and we will benefit out of it.\nAnything for that matter, it could be finance sales, even I go to chargeivity\n\n@44:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nwhich will check for what is 35, what is the value of percentage, 35 in 350, just 10% but still if there is any big number then I go there, finance like that, HR also, I go and check what is the leave policy that I can think of, I am a VAPT service provider, I go for that.\nRight, so the answer I am going to call a HR guy, hey hello, can you please pass on your company document, I will take a look at it then I will try to frame, but I get a ready-made data here, any department, I would encourage everyone to use searchability, I would definitely encourage.\nThere is an explorer in every area that you can in, right? don't rely on technology more, you have your own brain and you have to use your brain at times.\nyes always that we should know that we should know when and where to stop and use your brain or when to stop using your brain and rely on so that we need to have our own limitations and we have to set that boundary that's the that's the human layer we've been talked about right yes great so explore all ideas is is a very good advice that whatever you have in mind you should go try it out at least you should you should see if that helps you in your area what else anything else you should go do your advice to others who are trying to get started on it so this is a is into everything starting from cooking how to run I downloaded my seven days plan because I'm a badminton player I play badminton every day I gave I told AI hey I'm 43 years old and I play badminton\nIn the evening I do strengthening, muscle strengthening, you give me a plan, and it gave me, you can blah blah blah blah everything.\nSo I am a vegetarian, can you revise a plan? And it gave one device to plan. Then I said, I don't like this masala thing.\nOkay, then it corrected, and then it gave, it is like a doctor, nutritionist that, that can be a nutritionist.\nI don't know that later, and then I gave it to my wife, she ordered all the grams, and it is there on my table now.\n\n@46:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, daughter was analyzing a blood report with that yesterday, and I was laughing over there.\n\n@46:36 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nSo great, we are done with That's me, my wife is a microbiologist. Even she is also using. Oh my God.\nShe is also using that.\n\n@46:46 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great. And she is referring that with a birth, whether what's at CPT saying is right or she was saying, yes, it is right.\n\n@46:53 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nSo she is validating it also.\n\n@46:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's great. That's great. So yeah, I think I'm At the end of the interview, I have everything I think we are on time.\nhave one quick question, and this question is more about your strategy and your policy. So I have had three kinds of organizations in all my interviews.\nOne side of interviews, these organizations are like, everybody should be using charge repeating. But if you're not using charge repeating or any other LLM, you are actually making sure that we are not achieving our potential.\nThe other side is a company which says do not use charge repeating for your output. I do not want any output from charge repeating.\nThat's try to reframe as low as much as possible. And then somewhere in the center and there are many more shades of these.\nHere is the company which says I don't care whether you use charge repeating or not. All I care about is you have to give me this output.\nYou give me this output. In this time, and I don't care whether you use charge repeating or not. It's not none of my concerns, right?\neach spectrum of company, where do you fit in?\n\n@48:02 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nWhat's your policy? No, we do ask them to use it, provided you don't put our issues there. Now, to be honest, we deal with the finding issues of a customer.\nSometimes, immature people, what they do is they capture the entire issue and put it in geography and they ask geography whether it is an issue or not, you tell me.\nAbsolutely.\n\n@48:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat should not happen.\n\n@48:31 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nBut, prompting, they should know how to prompt and ask whether that isn't possible or through possible. So, that way we help our seniors to, prompt engineering is one important thing, right?\nEverybody should know, prompting engineering is your answer. Exactly.\n\n@48:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nshould know and everybody should use, but you judicious me.\n\n@48:52 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYes.\n\n@48:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat. Thank you. Thank you so much, women. Thank you so much, Alton. It is great to this and different perspectives on this if there is anything I can help it ever or do you have a question for me you have my connect you guys can always drop me a line or a question right it has been awesome thank you so much for your memory so much really appreciate it it was a kind of no we go on our regular work and we do things like this discussion gives us a kind of different mindset now yeah so normally I used to work for market research company initially days of my career so I know the kind of we do the kind of questions we do then there will be a hidden agenda in that now I don't want to ask you what is a hidden agenda but however if at all there is this data is going to help you to create a new AI tool if are more than happy to do the pen touch for you so you can consider as your mentor so see there is no\n\n@50:00 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYou're the judging thing, didn't you? Let me answer that for you, man.\n\n@50:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSorry, Sheldon, I think I broke off from you. They just give me one second to answer, man. I mean, this is an academic research, right?\nBecause it is an academic research, there is no hidden agenda because this is...\n\n@50:20 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nthis for thesis? Sorry to interrupt. Is this for thesis? This is a part of a research that I'm doing.\n\n@50:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's not a part of the thesis of people that I'm writing. Is here. It's pre-PhD research that I'm doing with IT Delhi.\nAnd this is a paper that I'm writing for it, and that's where this fits. so, no hidden agenda even, right?\nBut yeah, I mean, I'm here... But was making...\n\n@50:46 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nCouple of words, my very good friend and my ex-boss, we worked together in one of his start-up early 2010-11.\nSo, I know a couple, the moment he asked me, I definitely wanted to come and be able But of it, just that I couldn't get Charlton's availability because I thought he'd been bringing him also will help me to him.\nThis is good one. Sorry for the time. was a very dear friend.\n\n@51:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHe has worked with me on a couple of projects and stuff, and personally also we have got quite close.\nHe is a very likable person. So, yeah.\n\n@51:23 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nThank you so much. This is for you, for everyone. Yeah.\n\n@51:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSorry, Charlton.\n\n@51:27 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nNot just for you, like having person you mentioned, right? Yeah. everyone, he is a likable person.\n\n@51:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, He is that kind of very nice.\n\n@51:36 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nYeah.\n\n@51:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nVery invested in people he works with, and that's something I really love. So, I was recently hired by his company Simpler to do something for them, with a temporary assignment that I could call.\nAnd this was about Genii and they were trying to launch a tool, which they could not, because of certain problems that you are facing.\nSo, they wanted to consult me to help them out on that. And when he talks about other people in the company, I mean, he is so, this guy has not been able to deliver for the last 9 months, but he is a good person, right?\nAnd I don't know how to tell him that he is not able to deliver or push him. I mean, I have not seen a person so invested in his team and wanting to bring up his team and do stuff.\nI mean, they really like that guy.\n\n@52:30 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nCooler. Thank you so much.\n\n@52:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwill really, really have a video time.\n\n@52:34 - Sharlton Shadrac (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\nThat's my time, man. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n@52:37 - Bivin Jacob (SecIQ Technologies LLP)\ncare. Bye.

Very good, very how are you?\n\n@0:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nVery good, good. good, very good, looking forward to it.\n\n@0:24 - rahul ML\nLet's hope for the best. Thank you. I'm able to hear you clearly.\n\n@0:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAre you really hearing me now? It's slightly better. Your voice is a bit more comfortable. Yes.\n\n@0:40 - rahul ML\nYes.\n\n@0:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm not able to hear you because have to the best time. I'm not able to to hear you. hear you.\nI would love to understand you. just to give you a brief, I'll give you a 27 years in the industry, technology like that, probably know me through a gamma and then like ESW and then like any other company across, I consult with a lot of companies.\nSo, so the PhD got there, right, or PhD is represented by the research of the PhD, what can we benefit, how can we benefit people out of this PhD research at all.\nBut on ground here, what is the reality on ground, right? So, I've been talking to multiple different industries, all the CEOs and CDOs who are actually pushing it or let's say don't even want to push it.\nWho knows if it's bad here or not? Right? So, I will divide this into three parts, Let's just capture some information for the cohort in the pandemic.\nAt any point in time, you can say data I don't want to share. Yeah, you can say you can make a share to the ground.\nYou don't want to quote it anywhere. It's absolutely fine both ways. Okay? So, first part is the first part is the average number in terms of the industry, my numbers, et cetera.\nSecond part is average number in terms of the industry, my cetera. So, the average terms of the industry, cetera.\nThird part of the interview, let's talk about opinion. You want to do question-answer based on your question.\n\n@3:27 - rahul ML\nthat's really better. We'll mix much so I started with question answers.\n\n@3:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes, yes. I'm just asking and I'm still at the tip of the iceberg.\n\n@3:36 - rahul ML\nSo I'm with you, I'm with you. I'm going to start with you.\n\n@3:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, industry or sector, it's a marketing distribution and what sector entertainment? We'll get entertainment, yeah, films and entertainment, right?\nAnd specializing towards distribution mostly.\n\n@4:00 - rahul ML\nSlightly more marketing and distribution and syndication, syndication of what we sell content to platforms. Okay, great, great.\n\n@4:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat would be the company size in terms of employee and revenue?\n\n@4:13 - rahul ML\n10 to 12 employees and we're looking at about half a million dollars of revenue every year.\n\n@4:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, that's a bit small but vegan. I'm not doing it today. You have been doing it for many, many years.\n\n@4:33 - rahul ML\nI'm going to this.\n\n@4:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's good here. This is great. In terms of, let us say, genetically, so two parts may act towards industry or act towards our own company, right?\n\n@4:47 - rahul ML\nWhat industry?\n\n@4:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat do you think the general AI adoption kit is now? Sir, I think very, very whatever I've seen.\n\n@4:55 - rahul ML\nAnd I'm also learning a lot about AI to an extensive program. But let me just comment on what I've seen on a day-to-day basis.\nI think the most where it is used more, I feel, is in the creative spaces and in the creative renditions.\nKnowledge, yes, would say. Yeah. More creative. for example, if I had to pitch a project or pitch a service or pitch to a set of people who want to invest in the film business, all my creative material besides the business material, all my creative material would largely now have a touch of AI in it.\nOkay, like from making it look better to better story time and presentation to outstanding visuals and voice enabled, music enabled and so on and so forth.\nIn fact, we take great pride in doing one of our pitch presentations for a film that we are to raise money on, completely done on it.\nVery. human addition there is of course doing it yourself, and we got some voice dubs in different languages, which we believe is still a little time away from getting near perfection.\nBut we've done the entire season on this and it just jumps out at people and saying, okay, a monalia.\n\n@6:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd we shot this, I said, no, we haven't.\n\n@6:21 - rahul ML\nI mean, we spent three months doing it, but it was worth it because you just have to subscribe to the software and add one person on it.\nThat's right. So I think the presentation industry, pitching processes have become a lot more cooler because of this. becomes a lot more, I should say, in your face, where people start not visualizing on their own trip now, but then when we keep up with the space, I might be like, okay, okay, don't go on your own trip of how this shot will look and how the girl will look.\nThis is what I'm showing you is what it's going to do is a smaller version of what we're trying to achieve.\nAnd that actually helps all the departments in the creative process. If looking at costume is there, I'm looking at art, it's there, I'm looking at it's there.\nlooking at the tone of the film, it's there. I'm looking at music, it's there. looking at opulence, it's there.\neverything is covered when we do the entire season, which is really, really, I think, beneficial and it kind of should become the norm.\nIt's going forward with people who want to make an impression. There are production houses who are so big, they don't need to do that.\nAnd then there are production houses who are also getting into production, that's not thinking from that point of view.\nWhen we're thinking that, actually, I have to impress someone. I'm maybe sitting there on this side, but I have to start from zero here again.\nSo, that is the first thing that's happening. The second thing that I use personally, myself, when I do a lot of is data crunching, number crunching on trends or numbers on box office.\non other countries that will accept cinema that we are making or cinema we're trying to produce. So basically they are storming?\n\n@8:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSorry, they are storming along with the same country, right? The complete language.\n\n@8:14 - rahul ML\nI have data on all his last films where it released, the market's Italy's, box office, the satellite sale, the music sale.\nI have every interview number. I pair it with other actors, I pair it with directors and I'll get more data.\nSo it's really really helping to get a sense which was earlier not available. Now the thing about here I'm going go with chat or whether it's deep-sea or whatever you're using.\nIt's not creating its own. It's scraping the entire web universe on information and presenting it to you in smarter ways.\nThat's right. it has that itself brings in validity in terms of appendices. We can also do available info, which we would have done anyway.\nWe would have stepped into websites, filed it together. So it's just crunching your time, because it's doing that processing for you.\nit's ending it in a format that's on, and then it can refine it for the filtering down. So I think it's a great boon.\nI mean, at 10 days of work on research and feasibility of a project, I can now finish it in almost 24 hours.\nAnd I can now do it. I have serious data. When you have data and knowledge, it is powerful. That's all you have.\n\n@9:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's what we have.\n\n@9:45 - rahul ML\nSo that's powerful enough for you to be able to go into a portal and say, listen, I think this is where it stands.\nThis is the data that's presented, and these are the opportunities that lie. So I think that definitely helps on the mathematics side.\non the business feasibility or project design whatever you call it and that's one the other thing is processes right now if I want to say release firm and somebody comes to me with the with the project and says can you fix a release plan I can actually start creating AI agents and bots to actually curate a plan right giving all the inputs and that's what that's what it can do magically because otherwise it's very hard to find available info if I want to know second that he placed in my religion and I got but detailed you know chain wise less scientific to find then just lying all over the place absolutely and you need specialized knowledge which is not required anymore absolutely so I think that this will help a lot that I can see myself finishing release plans in the day versus going taking two weeks on it because phone that day that's no more said we do groundwork right we've been trying to do groundwork absolutely pick up the phone and\nYou know, you have to take out their memory, their books, why would they give them to you personally, that's the bigger question.\nknow, we have relationships should be in the industry for long, they know that we won't misuse the data. But it is that cumbersome at the end of the day, it is time consuming.\nSo this will really help set that out saying, okay, I need to create a release plan in India, this is the term, this is the genre, these are the actors, these are the directors.\nAnd that's a start point, so that's not the end point. That's not the start point. So the start point would be, it didn't make a measure, but the producer is going to come back and say, really fast or you're One of the two things will happen.\nSo you can't call it stupid. So it really helps in creating, in my opinion, can do wonders if you assign tasks.\nSo the agents in AI is what I think. would be the next level of work and simplifying work, not doing it for you.\nLike I don't see replacements here. think everybody talks a lot about, you know, replacing people, but it's garbage in garbage are the principal fundamental of computing.\nthe beauty is whatever you throw in will come out. So, similarly with AI, right, if you throw in complex stuff and you bring on complex stuff, but you need somebody to throw in stuff.\nEven if you have to command it has to be human otherwise it's not going to happen.\n\n@12:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, and then knowledgeable human at that.\n\n@12:34 - rahul ML\nSo, basically we'll have to upskill again to understand how to use this. Otherwise, we'll be just sitting behind and saying, oh, they've taken over our life.\nWell, they haven't. You still need somebody to run it and you still need somebody to give it commands. only thing is you need to understand it how to speak that language.\nSo, that's what is going to be demanded of human beings. And if you don't get there, so you will be extinct.\nNot that anyway. So, if you place a vacuum in your house and just let it be there, it's not going to start on its own daily programming.\nSo you have to be able to take that step and show this and I need to learn how to deal with the new automation or make my life simpler and you'll have to do that.\nSo you get time in doing interesting other things. So I think in the industry, largely I think it's going to be going to help seek out a lot of work for the business side, definitely help in the creative side.\nDefinitely like someday when I meet, I'll show you the season that we've done. It's just fabulous. Now for the entire AI effort, you just ignore it after point because you get sucked into what the model has created.\nBut it takes my hours. mean, again, if we didn't have people, we can't just say, hey, listen, drop a video on this on this storyline.\nIt will not do that. You'll have to dig out each team. You have to give it the right syntax.\nYou have to give it the right look that you have to train it to. give you what you want and you cannot miss out on all the learnings that you have done in the last twenty five twenty six years right we have learnt out of that and AI is going to learn from you and you are guiding it cannot do that what you have done it has no knowledge it doesn't have that experience that you pushing it in correct so I think largely this is it become I think the the impact is going to be tremendously there are people knowing it yeah knowing how to use it I got I'm still learning work so we still why but a movie conference on my this is great this is great I've seen I've seen deep-sick network I've seen chat GPT at work I've I've seen the videos I've seen all right work I've seen so many other softwares at work it's just fabulous stuff I mean it's stupid not to use it but the nice you get the guys you get yeah in fact one of my friends was Jason Singapore is a music director he created an entire music video I'll\n\n@15:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nin entire music video right? Alita I think has more than 10,000 K hits it probably a few a week or so.\nWho does it without any camera being involved?\n\n@15:13 - rahul ML\nSo it has it has brought up, it has taken away the fear of technology also. Absolutely. pilot, fan of the film making a day, both hands are happy, film making it noisy, have we film for release technology?\nI mean now it's just becoming so easy to make it, I mean release technology. I'm like great, bring it on on that day.\nWhen you present yourself professionally, right, in a way that people are like, wow, this is good stuff. You know, put out processes, make them understand what can go right wrong.\nI mean, you can do tons of stuff. mean, if I just spend two days, I'll have my whole speed document ready on how things will be distributed, what the accounting process to name it, will sub\nGood job. have a link to it by little by a parallel. So I'm to pass on this to you suddenly.\nRight. Earlier, this is to happen into a personal meeting and many meetings. Now I can actually train it to have it automated and send an email out to this person and say, Hey, I would like you to read this before our next meeting.\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. yeah, it's just there. Yes, you can ask me. Great.\n\n@16:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I got three main things, right? Pitch presentation. Oh, yeah. I mean, you can actually get the creatives, et cetera, all that, right?\nSecond, I got was the data crunching where you could get all the data crudget, understand brainstorm, get things, right?\nAnd the third thing that I got was the process side of things where you can create a plan, can curate it, you can polish it, you can customize it for each customer, each way separately.\nmean, you can merge all these three things and get things together, but all these things are great when we talk about it.\non ground, what is the kind of benefit in terms of dollar value that you think that you are able to get out of it.\nNow, for each one of these, we can separate you all much, way you are.\n\n@17:13 - rahul ML\nI think, as it is very simple, you can actually do products more business and revenues than you are actually doing now.\nIf you automate, if you customize, if you have all of this done in the most efficient way through your own research through chat gods and agents that you create and through, you know, presentations, can, the straight answer is you can, you can have this whole game by 10x.\nAwesome, awesome.\n\n@17:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when we talk about this 10x improvement, are we talking about the time they can do it, I'm talking about the money spent doing it, are we talking about the quality of the output?\n\n@17:57 - rahul ML\nIn terms of quality, definitely, it's coming with the information that's already there, right? In terms of time, yes, it takes a little time to setting initially, but after that, it's a set of specific commands you can.\nAnd third, in terms of overall, you know, just the approach, I think it will, it will throw a lot of people off card because you can come up with some stuff that even they don't know about that problem.\nAbsolutely. So it's just, it's an overall jumping at every level. And more importantly, you will save time, which means you can do your next, if I'm taking one meeting a week and I'm now confident I can do three, three measurements of conversion probability because I have also.\nAbsolutely, absolutely. So why say it connects?\n\n@18:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBasically, in that term, we are seeing that, I mean, we are not only able to get better quality, we are able to have better output in terms of lesser time being used.\nAnd in terms of number of people required, all the specialization level required for everything, right?\n\n@19:00 - rahul ML\nSo the output it gives is also very interesting sometimes, mean it throws out stuff, you don't know where I put it.\nBut is a problem with this, right?\n\n@19:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd the biggest problem with this is, it can very confidently lie to you. And very confidently tell you that she was released by let's say Amitabh Bachchan.\nVery confidently it can tell you, right? It across and read it carefully, line by line and understand it and like come over a room, right?\nIt can really give you , sorry if I just think that word, but without any inkling that there would be something wrong between this, right?\n\n@19:39 - rahul ML\nYeah, and that you can actually say and I've done a lot of it, I said no this is wrong, please rethink this and come back.\nBut I mean I certainly can't because it is wrong. Sometimes the information you want is not correct. Or sometimes then you have, they haven't done a, the question is very simple so the output is very limited.\nThen it's in one or two deep time. you have to treat it like If you ask me, you have to take it like a human being on the other side.\nThe more human you are in a Q&A with them with the bots, more respond you're going to get it the way you want.\nAbsolutely.\n\n@20:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, I love the response and the fact that, hey, you do not treat the other thing as a know-it-all giving me an answer, but a human that is working for you and you are still responsible, you are still evaluating and you are the person who, this is your output, not the system's output.\n\n@20:30 - rahul ML\nAbsolutely. I would have personally done the same thing, and I didn't have a place where I could get it at one shop.\nthat's my website, Chaleet, after all the information.\n\n@20:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI was working with your TV line, and all those ESW sites that we had, we used to take out the TV numbers, TRP numbers, movie gear, had a week, there used to be\nOkay, so many people, 11,000, thousands of people per minute, coming to just see the numbers. we keep an box office, take a walk, keep an eye, an eye out, have to get deadline.\nRight?\n\n@21:12 - rahul ML\nCorrect.\n\n@21:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nToday, just like, okay, I can just query it out. No issues. You have access.\n\n@21:19 - rahul ML\nThe only thing is, do you know how to use this entire world, right? It's a cold time. Do you know how to use it?\nDon't then get to learn it as something like that.\n\n@21:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. These are the good things that we found out, could you see me that you find that, hey, I tried it out.\nAnd I mean, I have seen that maybe this could have worked, but it miserably fails. Yeah, that is possibility.\n\n@21:43 - rahul ML\nLike for example, we're so used to creating PowerPoint presentation. But here, and with our own styles and inserting Haja graphics and templates, but here it becomes very standard.\nSo you kind of missed that and then, okay, I have to create it again. So there are a lot of limitations that we\nthere because it's still, I think it's still figuring out the phenomena, I mean, I think the ability to dig deep into what's presented, whether, if you created something to rewrite it, give you options, to take point of views to become those experts and write back is phenomenal.\nmean, you can give it any after you want and they will come back to you in that point of view.\nIt's just that, yeah, is definitely going to be tremendous amount of improvement day to day. So, still, every day somebody is launching something.\nBut yes, it's, in my opinion, it's never going to stop. It's always going to go on. Absolutely. It's never going to stop and say, this is the best software here on this one.\nAnd there's every day one Instagram post will pop up saying that, okay, now you would do this. Now there's a pair of one available.\nSo, so be it.\n\n@22:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when you, You see this in the company that you're writing, what are the specific AI projects that you are implementing implemented?\n\n@23:12 - rahul ML\nNo, I'm personally doing it for any project we're setting out to do in terms of making a film. think a lot of it goes into the creative process, then it gets married to the business side of it.\nIt won't be any effective. There's no effect on It's not really viable. So when it comes to that question, I have to be ready with answer.\nI mean, it's my company and partners, but I generally take a day to come back to them and say, look, this is what the last available data says about this particular kind of film and this particular status that you guys are trying to use.\nAnd if you are, then this is the mathematics that exists, and so on and so forth. yeah, it does take me a day because I do all sorts of combinations.\n\n@24:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nto get the data out.\n\n@24:02 - rahul ML\nBut at the end it really helps because there is some data to look at. Because there is no data to look at.\nNow that some data I have friends in the industry, so I will pick the phone and back date. If I hit a very picture like it does not get actually.\nIf you almost know that it is 90% accurate, is 90% there because it is picking up from published data.\nIt is good enough because at this point it is a benchmark. Now the business is a business of variable than ego.\nIt is variable. So in that also if there is a semblance of something in a particular direction, you should use that as a yard state.\nIf there is something better than nothing, I always feel that. I mean if you have nothing then it is too much of a risk.\nyou have something then you know that you are taking a calculated risk to really go in place.\n\n@24:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd you can keep evaluating as you go ahead.\n\n@25:00 - rahul ML\nAbsolutely, and other stuff will drop in your face, the market trends will start growing up, other reports are running around, so you can always validate and cross validate, but look, and some of the stuff is, you know, instinctively, know, yeah, you know, yeah, you know, of it, a lot of content works on that, a lot of it works on your experience, exposure, market, and you're generally seeing how people are reacting, so it's a combination of all of that which, yeah, doesn't give you, because it's not human, but that's when you and the AI together can make it really, really deadly combination.\n\n@25:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely agree. So, anything that you feel like a strategic goal that you think you agree with or let us say in the coming six months, this is a strategic goal that I really feel that I want to achieve using Janae.\n\n@25:54 - rahul ML\nI think that it's going to be about processes, streamlining on processes across the world. board, when there is production processes, marketing processes, distribution processes.\nSo that's definitely going to be something that I'm going to look to do slowly slowly. And it's also going to be about reporting a lot, it's I think the biggest gap in our business and the biggest leak in our business is when they're doing production.\nAbsolutely. Besides that, all that, you have no idea. But if you really have good process controls, which are fueled by AI and created by AI, then I think everybody down the line in that production unit, they need to be three people only appointed to do that and use that.\nThat's at least you know you're getting the important contract. But I think setting this up will help us, I mean there's no doubt about it.\npeople who don't use AI are going to sit and scratch the rates now. Because it's just not about creative, it's about doing some amazing process work, which you need because you're working with a team of 100, people.\n\n@27:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyeah absolutely absolutely and that brings me to a question where I have asked this question from multiple people and I have had three major buckets of responses right one response is the question is do you think that you should push people to follow AI in your company and make sure that they do it and make it mandatory for them the second option that was there a lot of people do this is hey I don't want to make it mandatory as long as my work is being done and it's done in time I don't care whether they're using AI or not and the third answer that I got was I don't want to want them to use AI because when they are using AI they're not giving me quality products right so these are three different answers that I've got what is your ticket should you force your employees to go get AI because without that we are going back as a company would you want them to you feel like you do it you don't like you don't do it what's what's your ticket I tell you how I look at it I think that it needs\n\n@28:00 - rahul ML\nYou need to figure first where your company is at, it's like a drive, okay, where are you, I have an intro stage, growth stage, intro growth, like a bell curve, okay, let's put the bell curve, standard MBA stuff, right, and you say where you are and say hello me, happy, if I'm cluttering and then I'm saying take a up to the layer, I'll be like that, I'll be just a little later, okay.\nThe other is moving, his other is taking it up and saying listen, I've just started it, if I learn it now, right, if I learn this, come and encounter the habit of using it very strategically, okay, the employees who need to use it, all right, then you're actually enabling a whole mindset to move forward.\nAbsolutely. It is not about opening the laptop and saying I have to use it, it's saying that okay, this option is available in our office, right, which you're actually going to have.\ncompany and if that's the outlook where you're democratizing the usage, something to take things forward, that's the way I would look at it.\nThat means that somebody has a choice or doesn't have a choice. But you've sent the agenda saying that listen we should because it's a good thing and it will only help us move things faster and better and we can complete our task which means we can take up more and we can decrease.\nanything that eventually results in more income producing activities needs to be done, in which case if this needs to be done then it needs to be done.\nBut there's no focus, it's going to be no force really. It doesn't make sense to have force.\n\n@29:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, I agree with you. So in some sense, the answer that I got was this is something that is critical for the business and if you think that there is, I mean if this actually affects business you should do it and this has to be done.\n\n@29:56 - rahul ML\nLook, I again don't want to do it because see I'll tell you a lot of it. is also scared of fear.\nA lot of people have fear about will I know how to use it, what if I use it and it's incorrect, the third of all that kind of stuff.\na lot of it, a lot of this comes from that fear which if you further say that you have to then people will go over into a shell right and then it up now.\nSo I would think that you should and it's saying that it's available. We would love for you to use it and increase your own ability.\nYou need help on how to use it.\n\n@33:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nand let us know what you have, okay, so we know if there is anything that we need to say in presentations or in-person meetings, then we don't want to say, hey, look, this is what I have used, this is the data, it may be wrong plus minus, I mean, I can cover my backside, but I would always look at a mindset of a company, like if I am running it, then it would be about what takes you forward, what not what, will not take absolutely, so what I understood was that instead of saying go use it, we say, hey, these are the benefits you get, whether you want to use it or not, have a look at it, it's like this, everyone in this side, one would like to,\n\n@34:00 - rahul ML\nGood salesmen, sales benefits, a great salesman, sales feeling. That's right, that's right. So I want to be that great salesman.\nI'm saying great, it's available. Right, so now let's just look at operations a bit.\n\n@34:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo this is like moreover technology using technology in different ways. But there are other operations like there would be some amount of HR handling, some amount of sales, some amount of marketing, right, some amount of where, I mean, other than you, the rest of the team needs to go operate, do things, right?\n\n@34:42 - rahul ML\nAre we utilizing certain things there? And what is your take at that? I think it will be eventually, we haven't yet started doing it, but yes, eventually it will happen.\nAgain, it's going to be just to make system easier. And you know, at a snapshot, if I'm able to see what's going on with employees or their timing or the administrative process around you, but it's wrong.\nThen I should be able to see it in the snapshot without calling the HR head and say, hey, you haven't sent me the email today, right?\nSo yes, I want to save my time in not making that fall. Right. want that person to save their time in not counting that excel sheet, instead telling data from something that's already going on.\nSo it's going to be, it's going to be reverse engineering most of the time, where you're going to say, huh, yeah, I say, we spoke like I need to do this.\nSo it's going to do that. But yes, I would. So it's really up to them. mean, that like, it's available.\n\n@35:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe have a subscription for people to use, who had used it. But it's really going to be up to that person's approach.\n\n@35:52 - rahul ML\nMakes sense. We are happy with the result. We are saying, okay, if the result is good, however you've done it, we are happy because that is the practical side of business.\nAbsolutely. Very cool. Very cool. And I mean, we are done with this section.\n\n@36:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nQuick things where you're looking at the important. So in hindsight, imagine you know what you know about LLM today, right?\nAnd now you go one year back with your current knowledge of AI. What would you do different? I had studied by India.\nDefinitely sure. If I knew this a year ago, then I would really start doing a lot of things differently, like especially\n\n@35:00 - rahul ML\nAgain, there's always been this lack of knowledge, available knowledge, right, so I would actually, I would just be happy to dig out how much knowledge would save a lot of my time, which I have spent without knowledge, so like I've gotten 100 meetings, I could have done 10 and I know, you know, this is the right person to meet or to my wasting my time, so that's available through little data and little insight.\nNot that you can replace the meeting, but I'm just saying that I would have done, I would have been more efficient, basically.\nI would have basically saved time, or let's just say I would have been, it would have been a more focused approach.\nSorry, sorry.\n\n@35:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo with that data, you would basically improve your efficiency. 100%. Yeah.\n\n@35:49 - rahul ML\nAnd I would give more time to myself, so I could do some sort of activities, I could do something else and worry about the engines doing the rest of the admittment.\nAnd not worry about then the state paychecks have to go and it's taken care and money is in the bank, the emails gone, form 16 again, you know it's just that.\n\n@36:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo those things I'm very keen to automate all of those things, but it's going to get there and it's going to get there very soon, right?\nIf you look at hindsight and again, once again we have to take this part, so if you look at hindsight, what is the most notable success you have had so far?\nsingle success where you can say dollar value but this is the most portable success I have had so far.\n\n@36:57 - rahul ML\nJust available access knowledge. Okay, I think that's going be the success translating it into translating it into business and opportunity in time is up to the human skill.\nRight? But I think it's just been that there's been tremendous knowledge. I have access to what I'm learning about access.\nThat's the best success. Yeah, and the biggest revelation that you have had using that we could do all of that.\nThis is really happening in front of our eyes. That's like what we care about. It's just a marble and over everything that's happening.\nAnd it's meant to make human lives easier. I think that I'm only seeing the good side of it. So I think it's just understanding whatever's happening.\nIt's privilege that we are learning and seeing it. The kids who are going to be born in this era are going to get it by default.\nBut we've always been the The people who've seen things evolve in front of us. all the TVI have real phone, phone, visual phone, mean, whatever's happening is happening for us.\n\n@38:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhen I tell her daughter that I used to pay 30 rupees incoming per minute on a mobile phone.\n\n@38:17 - rahul ML\nShe doesn't believe me. And we used to write by BSD bus. Ah, yes.\n\n@38:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's the last question that I have. What is your recommendation for companies who are wanting to use JNI for their gender transformation or decision?\nYes.\n\n@38:32 - rahul ML\nWhatever the language you're discussing, Vicki, I think AI is a must. For anybody who wants to, like I said, move, my mantra would be, move your company forward.\nRight. if it's moving forward, it's only going to be income-producing actually. Yes. the other half, moving forward career, just by making fancy processes, it's not going to help.\nIt's got to be linked to the income-producing actually. And how does the income grow? If you streamline things, work at the\n\n@39:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nefficiently do more of the same thing it will grow yeah, so what you are what you are Suggestion is is very simplest like move forward use it as a tool do not use it as something that really does magic It's just a tool that you can use faster.\n\n@39:16 - rahul ML\nIt is a tool and there's no doubt about it And I think if you look at medical sciences air face the biggest role there It's going to change lives Is going to save lives, but besides that for normal businesses I think it's going to be it's going to be greatly productive.\nIt's going to cut down on processes that earlier were taking days and months I mean, we also have something on a virtual studio now, right?\ncan actually belong to any location by actually being in one location Absolutely, I thought that would happen and there are some five people who know how to run a virtual studio in the world So if that is happening on the production side Then so you don't need an emoji to sit here Production check, okay, you don't so it's going to disrupt\nIt's definitely going to disrupt but it is going to be able to disrupt only you know how to use it to disrupt So the challenge really is not for anything else, but for the you would look at him Absolutely hitting the nail right on the head But yeah, this I hope this helps and good luck for whatever you're doing it Thank you.\n\n@40:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you Rahul and thank you for taking our time in and let me know how this goes and what you're doing Yes, I will share the final report with you So that you can also see how others are playing this out and how bad thoughts are on this please that would be Phenomenal definitely definitely.\nThank you.

How are you doing? I'm good.\n\n@0:12 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI'm good. How has life been written you? Life is good.\n\n@0:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLife is good.\n\n@0:19 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nHow about you?\n\n@0:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWell family lives mostly when we met we were mostly I was free now it's family life so it's mostly working family and that's how it goes.\nSame here.\n\n@0:34 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAbsolutely. Yes, yes. How many kids do you have now?\n\n@0:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI have a daughter and I want to keep it like that. I have one son, that's it.\n\n@0:46 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAwesome.\n\n@0:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's really difficult to bring one daughter and one son up in a good way. You can of course bring up any number of daughter and kids.\nIt's really difficult to bring one really really well up. absolutely that's how we feel I mean to see every series that she has to see before she sees she's 13 right now so she needs one guidance into very soon she will be out very soon she'll be like hey dad I don't need you anymore so let's this is the fun part so this is the part where you are the best and the most learned man on earth and there's nobody better than you anything that can be on the face of this it's true I want to miss a minute you know what I mean I want to cherish every moment absolutely I mean since Michigan was born I started working from home and now that she is like about\n13 I feel that okay slowly very soon like say like one year or two years she'll say I mean I don't need that much of your time I want to be of my own so yeah come on oh no they I mean trust me the way that I see her friends and everybody they have different life things are changing but I mean I can see that slowly happening yeah works across so so this this protocol that I wanted to conduct was basically so I went in for a course in IIT Delhi IIT Delhi like one of the most premier institutes in technology and management in India yes and I wanted my PhD so before I wanted to full-fledged jump into our PhD I wanted to one research just to mock and see hey how well we can do that and how much of my effort my time it takes\nand how much of a difference I can make with this, right? So, the topic that I choose was AI is everywhere.\nEverybody is saying AI, this AI that when I will cook my food, robots are going to come in, etc, etc.\nBut in reality on ground for all the companies, and I've interviewed a few, I want to finish up 200 companies roughly.\nBut for all these companies, what is the reality on what worked for them, what did not, right? What are the things that came in and seemed very well when they started was very promising, but it didn't yield results or something that just seemed to be very trivial, but it really gave up good results.\nAnd here, the way I'm segregating is I'm not looking at traditional AI. Traditional AI is what UNI used to do, right?\nIn terms of official information, terms of everything, what I'm looking at here is beyond the at generative air. And when we talk about generative AI, talk about text being made, images being made, we talk about the different logics that can work across, we talk about logic or rationalization that it can do recently, So how are you while running your company, utilizing that, right, what are the different ways you are going across with that, what are the different avenues you think it has worked for you, what worked for you, that's the information I wanted to pick your head on and understand from you.\n\n@4:37 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAbsolutely. Yeah, and I use AI, I use AI pretty much every generative AI, even every minute of every day almost.\nIt doesn't have to ask me, I don't use it with, you know, it's allowed me to sort of scale my business with using just me, know, and what I use.\nI mean, like, you know, I'm, I'm helping it. So use me code, you know, to code, helping it to write CSS, it's helping me to write CSS.\nI do a lot of inventory work with clients that sell online, you know, what it can do with Excel is like, be on, it would save me hours, save me hours every day.\nI'll be like, Oh, like, find this column, find this range of values and it will pull into another sheet.\nAnd it doesn't really make mistakes in Excel. don't know how, but other things, though, it makes mistakes. And that's what I noticed mostly with image generation, as you probably know, and that takes a little bit more time.\nBut I have, I'm subscribed to a number of generators. know, I spend quite a bit every month just on AI as well.\n\n@6:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nLet's take a step where, let's first define for the sake of this interview, what industry and sector will you define this work into?\nMarketing development and what sector, I'm sorry, if we call your work as an industry, what industry and what particular sector in the industry would that work be?\nThe sake of marketing and the room from what I understand?\n\n@6:30 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nMarketing and development, yes.\n\n@6:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAny specific focus that you are specializing in right now or when it's generally, when fairly the wider area of marketing development?\n\n@6:41 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt's pretty broad, but in terms of marketing, what it can do specifically on Facebook, Facebook marketing, in terms of generating content, generating imagery at copy creative.\nand also even coming up with the marketing plan itself.\n\n@7:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, that's great. And what would be, if you won't mind sharing that, what would be the rough company size right now in terms of people and everything?\n\n@7:17 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nMy company itself? Yeah. Well, you know, we don't have any full-time employees, know, maybe two, but we, you know, we have a branch of freelancers and contractors.\nMaybe like, I'd say five to ten.\n\n@7:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust like earlier, so you are basically mostly learning a solo show with a bunch of different contractors and freelance people.\n\n@7:44 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYes.\n\n@7:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I would put around five to ten and in terms of revenue, if you are comfortable sharing. Pardon? In terms of revenue, if you are comfortable sharing.\n\n@7:55 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nOh, revenue? this year we're going to make, maybe around. 400k as a company.\n\n@8:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAwesome. Awesome. That's great. And I mean, the next question is around the level of AI option. And I hear you.\nI hear you that, hey, earlier as an individual, I used to do so much. But now with AI, I can do so much, right?\nI can maximize my own potential. what all, I mean, let's go one by one and then go into depth of those things.\nSo what is the most number one thing that AI has to do most of the image generation? Ag generation, brainstorming, marketing plans work.\n\n@8:38 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nMe personally. It, when it's changing, it's changing all the time. I used to lean on it for, you know, copy, just copy for everything, copy for websites, copies for, for emails, you know.\nBut now, and now I use it most for image generation. I'm using it now to redesign. sites that are already designed You know the website generators that are coming out now.\nThat's mind-blowing I'm just like one sentence and like it comes out Looking better than I something I could have worked on for six months and like It's called B12 B12 yeah, no not yet.\n\n@9:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm not I'm not playing around with it. How is it? It's brand new.\n\n@9:28 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nOh, sorry It's it's miles ahead of the other ones and it's fast and like one click and you you just get a whole new generate generations for You know a website blaze or slide Does it give you a downloadable site or does it like I see a password?\n\n@9:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo, no, it's like a front.\n\n@9:49 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt's like a front-end editor and it's very easy to use I found But then you publish it one one dollar well one dollar for the first three months and then $50 a month so to\npublish the domain so you know hopefully that gets better but that's decent depending on what they're doing. You know what it is and you know it remains to be seen how robust they are and you know whether they're going to stand up you know over time and what the customizations can be at the end integrations but it seems like they're working on all that so you know I looked at it last night it's crazy.\n\n@10:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo my experience with these was that when you start it does a great job but as you keep building and as it becomes bigger then the utility starts decreasing.\n\n@10:41 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAnd that was my experience in the past but so far this one has been good. I'm ready to throw out WordPress.\n\n@10:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHow far are we starting to have some kind of running projects that we have played around with change and all.\nI said when do we have how much have we used this in terms that hey this will become large.\nor has matured a bit, how is it right now?\n\n@11:04 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI mean, just this reason is yesterday, you know, last night I was using it for it. I'm going to use it again today.\n\n@11:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI didn't use it last week.\n\n@11:12 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nknow what I'm saying? Everything's changing, so rapidly. know what I mean? Yeah, that's true. thing mistakes. Chachi Petit was making two weeks ago and stopped making them.\nYou know what I mean? It's crazy.\n\n@11:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd we have seen that deep seed coming up, right? Pardon? I've seen that deep seed coming up also. No.\nIt's now competing. It's a Chinese company that trained the same model, like charge GBD at 100, the cost.\n\n@11:44 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nRight? I'm not competing there. Like the server cost or what do you mean? The cost of trading and the cost of training.\n\n@11:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOh, wow. So imagine, it's trying to compete there. In a big way, if you Google it up, you should be able to find this.\nI'm sorry.\n\n@12:04 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nthink that's changing a big bit speed.\n\n@12:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nInteresting time to be in technology.\n\n@12:12 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nVery interesting.\n\n@12:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo yeah, I understand when we get later are one thing that you have used a lot, right? And it really helps you scale your vision, your way of looking at things, way of delivering things.\nelse?\n\n@12:29 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt just makes me, I don't know, it just, I focus less on little things, but more on the big picture, which is great, like color schemes, just takes away time for sure.\nOK, it makes sense.\n\n@12:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo web generator in terms of color scheme, cetera, other than this, like generation of content. content as a marketing content and how easy do you think it is?\nmean does it need your guidance a lot? Is it like okay out of the box and just can make it out or?\n\n@13:09 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYeah well you know I actually I have a whole new branch of business that I'm just for Facebook marketing because of because of this generator that I work with car dealerships and you know I put up these these flash sales on on Facebook and you know the industry never seen anything like it because I've got them like a hundred leads in two days and all like on-face performs just from generating this crazy content that you know the AI comes up with it I don't even really do it but yes it comes out of the box except for image generation that takes takes little bit of time but it's worse in India and out video generation I need to think about oh my god yeah sure then you have\n\n@14:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthe generators like your stable diffusion generators etc that they're really good. of them are really doing well. They're making the boundaries.\nthe person like you can actually stitch together those smaller videos and make a movie out of it with the kind of creative where you are.\nI know it's crazy. Yeah.\n\n@14:18 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt's crazy. The one and yeah. Yeah. on. I'm scared. It's crazy. Oh my god.\n\n@14:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are all in the same wonder line together.\n\n@14:29 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYes.\n\n@14:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo Web Generator was one when it's content generation. Content generation as in I separated two with Web Generator being food mostly CSS, HDMI and all those things and content being images, videos, right?\nThose are the two things. What else is it also handling kind of personal marketing for you managing your WhatsApp account?\n\n@14:57 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt's not yet. You know, I still have, I still yet to, I want to start using it for an everyday task to make my streamline my life, all of these things for work are getting easier.\nBut like the things like administrative duties, like making sure my email gets checked to bring the things to the top, you know, putting things in front of me that I really need to see, because they still get missed, you know, things still get missed.\nACTION ITEM: Send Andrea link re: Many Chats tool for automating FB/WhatsApp/LinkedIn w/ AI - WATCH\nAs I'm picking up more work, it's becoming more challenging to manage all these things.\n\n@15:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHave you tried this one? So in Facebook and in WhatsApp, if you want to automate stuff with AI, there's something called many chats that are coming.\nNo. It's going to be really, really helpful for music. can try it out later on at some point of time.\nI'll leave a link with you once I'm done with the call. It will allow you to answer your Facebook, your LinkedIn, WhatsApp, or its own, with the flow that you have given it, and if need be.\nprevention is required, going to ping you and say, your intention is required in.\n\n@16:04 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nPhenomenal, that's great.\n\n@16:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's what I heard from what you were telling me. So, yeah, that makes sense. Now, this is done. Are you also using some kind of AI to manage the contractors that you're working with?\nSo, there are a lot of these people who work for you, mean, is that making life easier there as well?\nOr only the generation on the web part of things.\n\n@16:30 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nNo, no, I don't use it there. I don't use it for management. Okay.\n\n@16:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in terms of breaking the work down and giving it to them and checking whether it's done properly or not, that's still manual or whatever.\n\n@16:43 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nStill manual. Right.\n\n@16:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd I mean, with what you are seeing, what is your, let's say, if anything goes well, what would you really wish it to do?\nWould you still want it to go in like after you have defined the task, validate it, or would You still want to do it, man?\nWhat's the way that he would like it?\n\n@17:04 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nSome things makes me nervous when, you know, it's in control of too much, because there is mistakes to get made, you know.\nI wouldn't want to answer emails for me that I didn't know. still want to be able to review everything.\nLike, maybe I'm it makes me feel good inside too, to know that I did something myself.\n\n@17:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd does that mean that you, when you run a campaign, let's say on LinkedIn or on Facebook, right? Does that mean that you would like to answer each one of those people also?\nOr would you be okay with answering at least, let's say, a hundred people, a minute or... No question.\n\n@17:51 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nGreat question. right now, I do answer those people. You know, I have something that works for me, but yes, we answer everything.\n\n@18:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd do you think that that's a good thing that you would like to go explore for your business? Or is it like, okay, this is not what I want to be or where I want to be?\n\n@18:12 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nNo, to scale, we're going to have to, yeah, we'll have to do that. We want to run more of these campaigns.\nSo that might be it. I noticed sorry that the AI responses, especially the Facebook gives, people don't like it necessarily comes to come to fast.\nknow, it's like to, yeah, it doesn't listen to what people ask for. Especially, I don't know why Facebook is doing this, but it might scare people off.\nyou know, humans touch people still need, especially a certain generation of people.\n\n@18:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you still feel that although it is able to do good, but that human touch in terms of communication is still not there, right?\nYes. make sense. And do you really care if your vendors are using AI on their card? Because end of the day, if they are using AI, they will, when their costs go less, their time goes less, a lot of things affect you as well.\nI mean, it's, it's fair to say, I don't care what my vendor is using, they can use whatever they want to.\nBut if you, if you do that, your, your cost, your time, they get affected. do you really push them in terms of, hey, you guys, we should go and check out AI and use that?\nOr is it, hey, I don't care? What do you do?\n\n@19:35 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nNo, I, I, I would encourage them to use AI. I just sent, yeah, even last night, I sent a, I sent one of who did guys a link to, you know, Flutter just came out with a, with a chat GPT app, right?\nThe Flutter corporate. So I sent it over to them. I don't know, I didn't get any response. Maybe they were offended.\nI wanted to make tasks for them easier, especially the tasks that are harder for them, I know that are harder for them like the Y stuff, so they can just do what they do best, which is functionality.\n\n@20:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI conducted a seminar with them, I don't know that they told you or not, I conducted a seminar with them to tell his team on AI, give them a one day kind of a seminar, and by the very interesting much they really want to learn they want to do things, so yeah, good answer.\nSo if it turns to, let us say, some of God, would you push it, would you say, hey, well, you guys must go and check it out because it saves me time, it saves me money, how would you say, hey, I want to get it done, don't really care whether you use it or don't use it.\nit's their choice ultimately you know what I mean like whatever their custom way of working is that I would want it to be for, I would want them to use it and not tell me but you would also want to see some results out of it right like hey I mean the x person who is using AI is able to deliver this to me in 10 days you are taking 20 days can you make it go faster than me right so I mean in that kind of scenario would you really push it still or you say I don't care I mean you use what you want to it you are business yeah I would say use what you want to unless I know something blatant okay really do a go in AI right right right make sense and you you would promote you would just there we will push them to go try this out try that out the moment you see something like you did yesterday\nYou're not gonna push it here. If you are business, you are way of running it, all I care about is I want this thing done this amount of time, right?\nyou deliver it in that cost in that time, but I'm good. Yes, correct.\n\n@22:12 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nMakes sense.\n\n@22:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMakes sense. And in terms of what you have tried so far, so this started at a level where It was being thinking that, hey, is gonna cook your food and they're gonna clean your house and everything.\nI'm gonna even pick your nose. But now things are changing and it's getting more streamlined in terms of what can it do and what cannot do.\nThere's a two things we've tried and we figured out here it doesn't work right now. Any go up here, I need to start working.\nBut for now, we are not there and it's not gonna be like tomorrow. That's it. I invest and it's gonna write my email.\nIt's gonna just talk for me, right? And all those things are coming up. Yeah, there is some in the future.\nwhat do you think are the things you would not to One generative way to be touching for you. Good question.\n\n@23:10 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nMy maybe investments. We don't want anything to mess up It should be used as a work thing, not as a learning thing, not for school.\nThat's a huge thing, obviously. I can use the kids homework for sure. But not the other way around. Here is the thing.\n\n@23:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nA lot of stock broken companies have started using AI. were using regular AI earlier, for production and all. But now they have started using generative AI also.\nlast year as well. A lot of companies have come up which are basically teaching kids, like for example Khanumu, right?\nThey have these sucratic tutors that help students learn faster and do better, right? When I'm trying to hint at this, hey, there are certain ways, there are certain reasons because of which you say, hey, I don't want you to trust my investment.\nI don't want it to be teaching my kids whereas it's coming. Has there been a bad blood? Has there been, or is it basically your way of thinking towards AI or what is the background behind this choice?\n\n@24:39 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nWell, I think it's because in order to learn things, we need a certain amount of experience and trial and error.\nIf we get everything handed to us, we're not going to learn the basics. We're not going to learn the basics, even the programming of language, of anything, because...\nit will just lean on it too much and a chat GPG goes down what are we going to do?\nThat's right.\n\n@25:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's interesting. I mean, have you tried those personal LLMs where you can run on your own machine and it works like chat GPT, right?\nI mean something like open source llama or other open source tools that are already available and you can just run off your PC and it works like chat but it's not that quality of answers probably but for smaller tasks and easier tasks it can work across.\nyou tried that? Have you thought about that as a future strategy somewhere?\n\n@25:42 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAre you saying like a visual studio called integration with chat GPT?\n\n@25:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm saying is something like a llama where llama can run a chat GPT within your PC. You don't need open end, right?\nold version of chat jubyter running within your pc or your server or wherever you want to run i'm unfamiliar i have the native version of chat jubyter but i have to look into what you're saying not sure okay okay so you are basically using hosted versions of products on offer you have not tried anything on your own on your local pc any any element right correct yes i could yeah i could set it up i know what you're saying actually but yes i have not tried perfect if you mean anything just ping me out i'll probably help you out there in this world try things out there cool any other thing that you feel hey this is something that i will not hand over to ai one and to anywhere where you really miserably failed using ai and you couldn't actually make it deliver you\n\n@27:00 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAnd the other thing, you know, this is, again, this is all quite new to me. I have not really thought about anything else that I would not want to give to AI.\nAnd have you felt that something that you tried?\n\n@27:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI want you to write this article for me and it just messes up with the article all the time.\n\n@27:23 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYeah, yeah, it happens all the time, you know, the worst thing you can do is generate something and trust that it's the right thing and then it's not.\nSo I learned that a bunch of times. Just be lazy and copy and paste and then you'll see where that goes.\n\n@27:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPardon? I said, you just computation and goes bad, right? Yeah.\n\n@27:48 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYes. And if you don't read it, then, you know, things will start to, you know, things will start to go downhill very fast.\nBut in this scenario, the way that I've seen it, it is.\n\n@28:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSometimes, it becomes easier for you to do things on your own hand, other than actually getting connectivity or some AI to generate something, and then it takes more time to correct it than actually build it up.\nWhat? do you feel similar?\n\n@28:16 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAll the time. All the time. I'm like, why am I sitting here doing this for an hour? And when, you know, I could have done it in Photoshop myself in like 20 minutes.\n\n@28:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd how much of that would it be? So is it like 50% of the time it does it, 50% of the time it doesn't deliver what I want?\nOr is it like 80% of time it delivers what I want, but 20% it doesn't deliver? What would be the most continuous for you?\n\n@28:44 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt's still, you know, it's about 50-50, and at the end of the day, at this point, you know, you lose it on the other 50%, the time that you sit there.\nSo it's like, whatever you make it generate, you still have to check, you still have to work on it, and you still have to do the same thing again.\n\n@29:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's just that you have one assistant with doing a basic work for you or a basic groundwork for you.\nit like that?\n\n@29:13 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYes, yes. And like, know, it's really, the algorithm is really training us to learn how to use it. Yeah, that's, yeah, yes.\nAnd I, you know, I've taken now, you know, us learning how to write promises, anything like me. I need to learn how to write prompts better, and I know that, but, you know, that's what I need to do in order to stay relevant, stay on top, so the prompts, yeah.\nMoving to another side of things, and this is security, okay?\n\n@29:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you have some amount of IP as Andrea. have a style, you have a flair, you have your own choices, that makes you do things, and you are training the air to do that.\nWhether you work with it or not, when you are using AI, it is learning from you. Are you comfortable with that data that IP going out and being publicly available that tomorrow, whatever you are teaching or whatever you are doing, it can understand and have anybody as do it.\nAre you comfortable with that or would you prefer it? my IT, my data should stay with me and it should not go out.\n\n@30:31 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYes, I'm a huge proponent of privacy and saving this data. Yes, but it's not publicly, so you're saying chat GPT would steal my style, what I would prefer my preference on generating.\n\n@30:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\njust became a part of the larger collective, that's what I'm saying.\n\n@30:59 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nSo it is\n\n@31:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's still training, right? It's still training on what you are doing. I am doing, everybody is doing, right? At some point of time, it's going to be a part of the collective next version that comes up.\n\n@31:11 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIs that okay?\n\n@31:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFor the business? Is that something you would say, hey, I don't want to avoid this, not do this? What's your take on it?\n\n@31:22 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYou know, when I come to think of it, I never really thought about that. You know, I'm so caught up in the moment trying to just get something done that's, you know, up right here, you know, in front of me.\nI don't think about the future, but, you know, ultimately in order to make it better, it's going to have to do that.\nThat's right.\n\n@31:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBy the way, if you want to switch off privacy, is a setting in chat GPT that allows you to switch off setting where it can learn from you.\nYou've got to fight now.\n\n@31:52 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIf you need help. Okay.\n\n@32:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that's one. I think I'm mostly towards the end of my question. If we talk in terms of expansion of this, let's say you think about future plans and everything else, you definitely think, hey, I'm going to use what I understand with you is that you are very cautious in terms of the amount of usage of air.\nAnd one of the reasons might be creativity, but is that the only reason or do you think that it's not there yet?\nIt's not delivering what I'm looking for. It is good to play around with, but it's good enough for me to be actually using any delivery.\n\n@32:45 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI'm sorry, I missed the middle part of your question. thought it was.\n\n@32:52 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI said, I mean, is this is this a situation where you say, hey, this is if I look at my future, if I'm planning my future,\nAI strategy is something that's going to drive it and be kind of a final delivery portion of things or is it only going to be a suggestive let's say starter not the final delivery of things in your future of months.\n\n@33:22 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI think right now you know it's AI is not complete and what it can do for me you know I think it needs you know like you said in the future I would want it to be more complete you know just like a one-stop thing you know for everything that I generate and like you know it comes just ready out of the box but right now needs still a lot of hand-holding in order to you know to complete what I wanted to do anyway.\nSo yeah it's in my plans obviously to use but it's still as the as a resource not like that.\nYeah this is a common team that is to focus on and around.\n\n@34:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nto be used, I find that when we start, people are done, oh, is helping, we do this, I will do that.\nBut when we go to the details, when we try and jump into, is it able to actually deliver something?\nAh, yeah, I still have to do things myself, but it's doing a great job. Anyways, maybe not today, maybe tomorrow is going to give up something, right?\n\n@34:23 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nThat's what I see. You're right, you're right. And if that's your thesis, you got a, you know, that's a good thesis.\n\n@34:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, right. Cool, I think I have most of the things in hand. I have just a few quick questions that I have in your hand side, right?\nWhat is the biggest hurdle for you to use AI effectively? The knowledge is very good.\n\n@34:55 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI am to write the prompts, the correct prompt, you know. That is much challenge at this point, have in my head what I want, but I want to be able to say it efficiently, the workflow portion of it, the work itself has become easier in managing every day tasks to do this, stuff like that.\nHave you tried to use workflow tools with AI? No, I have this part of the new Mac, and it's supposed to have Apple Intelligence, I don't really know what Apple Intelligence does.\nI really don't know myself as yet.\n\n@35:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat did the same you with for Apple Intelligence?\n\n@36:00 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nthey said it was going to revolutionize things. hasn't done that. I do understand the processing, you said, to run.\nThat's probably what it's good for, but if you're not doing that, I don't even know why they market it like that, because it's not really now.\n\n@36:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBy the way, there are a lot of tools which are coming now that would probably allow AI to or give a PC with using your keyboard at mouse.\nFor example, opening AI, charge GPT people are coming up with something called operate. There was a very old tool that we used to use what's called self-operating computer.\nWhat it does is it just takes a screenshot of your computer, sends it to charge GPT, says, what do I do next?\nhave to do this. And then whatever this guidance comes back, it just does that for you.\n\n@36:57 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nSo you tell it here, I want to develop a website.\n\n@37:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthis is this and I then want to send it to Google and then I want to post it on LinkedIn and then you send and watch it to it.\nThat's great.\n\n@37:11 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nThat's what I need.\n\n@37:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you can you can explore that you can probably google up Operators. Yeah from OpenAI and you can look up self-operating computer that you can install and you can try it out if you want on your own.\nIt will start working on your computer right now.\n\n@37:35 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAll right.\n\n@37:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay and then if you've paid your all your work that you have done so far, right? What do you find as the biggest success with the end?\nWhat was the most successful thing it did for you so far?\n\n@37:53 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt was like single single thing. But more than single as well.\n\n@37:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust make it\n\n@38:00 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI mean, like I said, stuff you can do with Excel has changed my life for some of the stuff I have to do.\nSo what totally are you working with Excel with, yeah? I just uploaded a spreadsheet and I was told to do what is needed and gave it back to me.\nWith chat GPT, yes. I can upload it for a certain thing. I can tell it to generate an important file for certain programs and it will generate the file with everything that I need based on the criteria I gave it.\nAnd it can import, you know, it's crazy that importing exporting stuff like the inventory management that also do with Excel and XML.\n\n@39:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, I'm a bit worried about that because of the privacy right it would be really good if you switch off your privacy settings before sharing your Excel data with your numbers and everything because I don't want to be tomorrow going to chat with us.\nHey, what was any of your food? Can you give me an answer? what was going to chat with your settings and please switch it off?\nYeah, what is it?\n\n@39:32 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nis it? It would be in settings somewhere.\n\n@39:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI love to, you're using Mac, right?\n\n@39:38 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nYes. Let me quickly tidy over that.\n\n@39:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGo to chat GPT. can go to chat GPT menu. There are settings in chat GPT menu, okay. When you go to settings, it shows you account, app, chat bar, etc.\n\n@39:58 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAnd there you have\n\n@40:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think there is something for personalization that manages your memory, so you can manage your memory what you wanted to remember.\nThat's one part of it. And then there is data controls where you can actually allow it to improve the model for others or not.\nSo you can see data control and you can see personalization these two things.\n\n@40:25 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nOkay, so you were just turning off memory?\n\n@40:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI was memory might be useful but you should keep a check on what memory is it keeping for you.\nSometimes it can memorize you based on a joke and like you don't know what it's memorized things for. It's good to keep a track memory and it's good to keep the data control to improve the model so everyone switch it off please.\nI maybe don't want the more excellent data to model.\n\n@40:51 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nTo improve the model for everyone so I'm going to turn that off.\n\n@40:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, okay. Okay, and what else did I have to buy with?\n\n@41:08 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nThis is very interesting, know, interview and thank and I'm so interested in what you're doing, you know, also.\n\n@41:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, so I have been working extensively on AI for the past, like, quite long now. And right now, I'm taking a break, focusing on getting, let's say, a PhD degree.\nI am also working freelance with a lot of companies, setting up their IT, their infrastructure, projects that they want to build up.\nexample, India has a large food network, right, where the government purchases food. It's like the world's largest food network.\nThat's one of the clients I'm servicing right now. created their app for them. It's running. Then there are companies like simpler companies who come to me for consulting in terms of AI.\nIf you want to do this in AI, how can we do that? Or AI product is not working optimally.\nCan you help us on that out and make it better? That's going to work. For the last one, since April, I'm mostly into freelance and playing around with that.\nThat's mostly what I'm doing right now. Very cool, very cool.\n\n@42:30 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nIt's awesome.\n\n@42:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd it's been an extensive run in terms of deep AI and heavy technical decisions for a lot of different companies, which are doing millions of dollars of AI.\nSo I wanted to take a break and focus on smaller things, some things that we can make a bigger difference and so on.\nOh, good.\n\n@42:53 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI'm so glad. It's so good to hear from you too.\n\n@42:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah. See you a minute. I did not very long. that we connected. Yeah, absolutely.\n\n@43:03 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nI hope we stay in touch, know, let's take it. Yes, definitely.\n\n@43:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthere's anything I can do for you, you know where to catch me, take a number, please I'm going to share it out here for you.\nYes, absolutely.\n\n@43:14 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAnd likewise, anything I can do for you, So, you know, you actually the one that got me really started and all this.\nthank you. Always you, man.\n\n@43:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnytime.\n\n@43:30 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAll right. I'll put you on WhatsApp. What's up, right? That's right.\n\n@43:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat's my mail. That's my number. The mail that you got the email from is a temporary IID mail for you.\nAnd, and yeah, thank you so much for taking out this time. Anytime.\n\n@44:06 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nAlright. You have good one.\n\n@44:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you so much for your time. You as well.\n\n@44:13 - Andrea Venezia (Alto Palo)\nThat's best of luck.

And in terms of company size and when we say company size, we mean two things. One is the number of employees, that is the revenue.\nHow would we buy goods? At this point of time, in terms of revenue, let's say 500 pro plus in Indian companies, we are not touching anything at this point.\n\n@1:27 - Manish Sau\nSo, five hundred years, we are few plus in revenue.\n\n@1:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd in terms of people?\n\n@1:33 - Manish Sau\nIn terms of people, let's go with thousand people at this point of time. So, is the definition of enterprises?\n\n@1:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI am talking about overalls per se, only overalls, right? The overalls is going behind, so this is the kind of PG for us.\nOkay, but what is overall size right now? Not the PG, but overall size.\n\n@1:53 - Manish Sau\nWhat is the eight people team?\n\n@1:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEight people right now. Seven eight. What is the revenue, please? 30 40 lakhs a year okay now in terms of AI adoption to do here many one is I am building AI from a customer now there is I am adopting AI for my own purpose and using it on my own right so in terms of AI adoption how much do you think is adopting and using AI right now I am not focused with my own purpose or once is using AI a lot and what are the things you think contribute the most towards business so there are two three key things that we use AI a lot for first of all who put a writing architect miss saara cojaya copywriting basically everything copywriting is AI only and what is what is for once work with copywriting generally presentation I think from a presentation to a technical white paper to okay\n\n@3:00 - Manish Sau\nBecause a lot of, so one of our co-lateral is actually white papers, right? So all co-lateral buildings, marketing, marketing.\n\n@3:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWherever there is a need for content, specifically text content, we go to AI. That is one big area that AI solves for us.\n\n@3:24 - Manish Sau\nOne other big area that AI solves for us is Code reviewing, not coding, but code reviewing. Reviewing codes, debugging, all manual tasks.\nWe use AI a lot.\n\n@3:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhy not coding when this is to ask?\n\n@3:49 - Manish Sau\nThe kind of codes that we are writing at this point of time, AI coding has one big problem. This, the quality of codes, it's very\nIt's to maintain AID 10 cores, that is the biggest problem. We have tried two, three things, but it's very difficult to maintain cores as such.\n\n@4:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, easy maintenance is not easy, is that what you're trying to say?\n\n@4:18 - Manish Sau\nmaintenance is not easy, writing is easy, getting something from zero to one is easy, but then when you're trying to scale on top of it, then you will get stuck basically.\n\n@4:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGot it, got it, got Great. So, I heard till now that we have two main adoptions of AI, Gen AI that we're talking about, was copywriting and the other was code review.\nThat's it.\n\n@4:45 - Manish Sau\nThese are two major use cases.\n\n@4:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAs of these two tangibly, and again, when we say tangibly, it is in terms of numbers, in terms of time, in terms of quality, different different aspects, we can look at tangibility.\nThank you, Bill.\n\n@4:58 - Manish Sau\nWhat kind of benefit is copywriting?\n\n@5:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\ntrading and what are we giving you in terms of time saving that is the major matrix that we are looking into time saving and when you say time saving is like a factor of one factor of 10 what are you making it's a 10 x faster time to value okay.\n\n@5:18 - Manish Sau\nSo, for example, I'll give you a use case for this process. So, let us say I am writing our technical white paper but I am trying or I am trying to customize my white paper for a particular customer okay.\nNow, if I do it manually, it will take me at least to this.\n\n@5:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's not, it could have focused a bit, if I do take me at least to could have focused a bit My problem with technical writing using AI is that it becomes too generic and not specific to the purpose that\nare putting in. So, it loses a lot of you in the paper which is what's being sold because otherwise to both other papers.\nSo, how do you plug that gap where your core knowledge and you basically are also a part of it.\n\n@6:13 - Manish Sau\nSo, the first version is written manually and then we articulation the customization this is where the language and the communication difference.\nSharpening the sharpening the white for making it more sellable basically. The presentation skills. Yes, yes, yes. Indeed, we do one more thing also.\nFor example, I want to for example, I am think I'm changing my architecture little bit. So, let us what we do we do we will write it and we will draw it on a paper ideally.\nthat paper as an input and then we will ask it to explain and then we will ask it to make it better.\nThat is how it works.\n\n@7:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nand how how how effective has been for you. Very good. It's very good. So is it it also saves you 10x time?\nYeah, Great. Great. I have three things that we are using as an adoption but further on like as a specific AI project, right?\nIs this specific that you have undertaken and you see like, oh my god, this is like a humanless dollar value game that we are getting because of this project.\nmight be for you might be for your customer either way.\n\n@7:38 - Manish Sau\nSo dollar value game game make problem. There is one big major problem as of now the cost of inference.\nOkay. Cost of inference for AI is very very high as of today. Okay. So even if you use the best inference engines to use the best whatsoever is available in the market today.\nCost of inference is till a pain, specifically as the use case gets more complex or more stable. So, there is a dollar value in from a business front, but the technology becomes so expensive by design, the adoption becomes difficult.\nAdoption on, I mean, like a ROI? Yeah, ROI becomes difficult, more than an option, ROI becomes difficult.\n\n@8:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. So, again, coming back to this particular core, is there any specific AI project where you see that the ROI was much above you expected or it is really giving good ROI in terms of actual business value?\nYes.\n\n@8:57 - Manish Sau\nwe did an excuse matching use case. there dollar value in terms of man power costs and both saving time and man power cost was very very high.\nSo, will give you again I will quantify this. were a 40 member team who were doing this manually. With us it came down to around 3 people.\nSo, you gave directly salary of 37 people. Then you save error rate, save time. We can quantify into a business value relation kind of framework.\nObviously cost saving kind of a dollar value will be very high. And you were talking about inference cost. Does it balance it or does it still not balance it?\nIt didn't balance it there because it was we were calling it too many times. We were calling it too many times.\nyes the The mode and value creation, value realization was also very high in that particular project. But yes, they were not ready to, because it was an experimental project for them also.\nThey were not ready to take such a huge risk with one shot. It didn't scale where it needed to scale, it became a very small project at the end of the day.\n\n@10:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat was the reason of scale not being there?\n\n@10:33 - Manish Sau\nAgain, the value realization and the cost of value realized, were not, it became challenge for them. ROI was not standing out, this is what I'm trying to solve.\n\n@10:45 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, in terms of, let's say, let's not look outside of the customer, let's look inside terms of O1s. And within our own circle of O1s, what do you think would be\na strategic goal that you you set out for the next six months one year that using an AI this is a strategic goal I really want to implement I want to achieve this two three things I want to automate sales number one you make it I want to automate sales get customers across your office that is number two is such a one important realization by this time is when you drop things on premise now so the way to be interesting inside actually you drop things on premise and if you can have great it compressed runtimes okay in that case what's of inference is the entire cost of inference problem goes away ROI will be coming better\nYes, this is a very interesting interesting that's really interesting but you don't you you treat CPUs as GPUs don't bring in new GPUs CPUs as CPUs have to use a legacy infrastructure ideally artistic compute basically and then you have to make it happen So won't this be uh OPEX heavy or OPEX heavy?\nNo it will not be OPEX heavy because you're not adding in adding any new resources to the picture If you go to GPU right then again you are adding resources to the picture then it becomes OPEX heavy right it will not be OPEX heavy because you have already compressed the runtime it will not compress the runtime then it then it is again a problematic use case okay and what do we mean by compressing the runtime?\nSo you have to use pre-configured very lightweight runtimes Are you talking about small numbers?\n\n@13:02 - Manish Sau\nYeah, if you are compressing the model, you are distilling the model or you are doing something around the model that is compressing the model to the CPU native more than CPU.\n\n@13:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBasically, what I understand is you will use a SLM instead of a LLM and you distill the SLM.\n\n@13:22 - Manish Sau\nWell, you can use an LLM also, in that case you have to, so for example, you have to use an ONNX runtime kind of a thing.\nOkay. Upbeat comp is an NNNX runtime CPU native and you run open source models on top of it. It's such an architecture.\n\n@13:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNot state of art models, you are directly bringing in models on that premise only.\n\n@13:45 - Manish Sau\nLike 7B and above, right? Yes, yes, 7B and above.\n\n@13:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut with that, my experience is that the influence becomes very slow, painfully slow. That is where compute near source comes into.\n\n@14:00 - Manish Sau\nWe have to entirely rethink the architecture. Therefore, do you think the architecture, you cannot use the traditional architecture on top of it to make the community.\nIt will not work out. So, do you think the entire architecture, you have to take a look at the So, that this latency problem goes away.\n\n@14:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBecause the more you go towards CPU, the more the latency will increase.\n\n@14:23 - Manish Sau\nYes, definitely. At the point of action, it is not very much.\n\n@14:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut that point of action is quite slow. It is slow because the CPU is there.\n\n@14:39 - Manish Sau\nbecomes really painfully slow.\n\n@14:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nactively speaking, I have tried it, I was not able to get really effective solutions at the right time.\n\n@14:50 - Manish Sau\nSo, we have cracked these two a certain extent. We can look at the prior, what we have done, we have brought data, memory and compute in the same plane.\nThat is one area that we have, so once you bring it in this, then there are two big advantages.\nOne is nothing is going out. How do you bring it to the same plane? I am embedding DB directly on the computer.\nWe are going to do more basically.\n\n@15:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you are generally running vector DB and NLM, you need higher resources, right?\n\n@15:30 - Manish Sau\nI am using CPUs as a batch, so I am creating a lot of CPUs. One first one, one after I am batching it up.\nNo clustering basically. I am clustering CPUs. Not running on top of one, I am distributing the load on a cluster of CPUs.\n\n@15:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou are doing that on a local.\n\n@15:50 - Manish Sau\nthe first, right? increases the op-x. And the gap-x. So that is why my target is only enterprises because they are ordinary.\nready running this load on, they already have this in trying place. Okay, okay. If you cannot do this with smaller companies, because they have a number of nodes with them.\n\n@16:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are repurposing missing the compute power that they have. Yes, yes, yes, Cool, let's not digress. Let's come back to technical point of mind always goes in the right direction.\nSo, in terms of, let us say, asked achievement, if you look back at since LMS come in the last three, four years, what do you think is the biggest achievement so far?\nFor us, there are two, three things. One is our placement engine.\n\n@16:53 - Manish Sau\nSo, I'll take, again, I'll take technological advancements into place. Honest placement engine that we have built. One is, one is the value that we have delivered to, again, the education of the market is also limited especially in Indian market, that is one key point to look into.\nAdoption is not happening not because of LLM can do a lot of things or there is no direct value realization, there is also a lack of education also among customers, they understand that this is a great technology, but industry is, you know this better than me actually, 95% of Indian big enterprises do not have any high strategy in place, maybe it will be more but it cannot be less.\n\n@17:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou will be surprised money if I tell you, 80% of Indian enterprises still do not the cloud.\n\n@17:53 - Manish Sau\nSo I have experienced this, I have experienced this.\n\n@18:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou will be surprised and this is not only India, even in US, there will be problems.\n\n@18:10 - Manish Sau\nSo yes, because of this only, the adoption is so lower, value realizing so low at this point of time.\nWhy this? This is not showing practical implications, more than the diligence of the models or improvement in infrastructure or even quantum chips which are coming in.\nThe other problem is people relying on the technology, people believing in it. There is a, and people do not have a use case also, that is very surprising.\nPeople do not have a use case to actually try this. So they are expecting the use case also from us.\nSo use case discovery is at least a three to six months process. That's right. After that you are getting into something tangible.\nFor the time, that is one of them is humongous.\n\n@18:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWhat you are saying, it looks like somebody is giving you. He and saying guys are locked together. Get locked together.\nlocked, That's painful. That's painful. Right. So if we take home lunch into place and everything goes hunky-dory like it's going right?\ngoes well. What do you think will be the biggest achievement you will do in the next few or few years?\n\n@19:26 - Manish Sau\nSo we are in a position at this point of time, key, we can build a great execution layer. Okay.\nTwo, three things. compute to the point of action. Okay. As the big, big problem in, and it needs to be done in AI, it has been a big, big problem and it needs to be done in AI.\nSo we have cracked it, not completely, but we have cracked it for certain expectations. That's good too. The of AI, bigger problem than AI is the infrastructure which is running the AI.\nAnd in that, today what we are doing is we are actually clubbing in lot of tools. Right? And whenever you are doing, this is a fundamental engineering problem.\nWhenever we are clubbing in multiple tools to do something, it by design becomes non-efficient. It's a fundamental engineering problem more than an AI problem actually.\nThere's too much to handle together. Too much to handle together and it brings some layer or the other layer will actually get up by design.\nSo, that case what we have figured, could build a unified in execution infrastructure to a certain extent.\n\n@20:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, if things goes good and considering our architecture and our, excuse me, and it solves a true paranoia problem among enterprises considering all these factors.\n\n@21:00 - Manish Sau\nthe humans we should have, sorry, by another three years we should have go to 300 customers using this, but all of them, the layer that you are talking about.\nYes, because people are realizing the value, they are, as Indians, are taking action slower and they are de-risking. have never seen in my entire career, I have never seen this scale-could-y-risking.\nOkay, little of don't think it's obvious can't communicate if we've we we do, have or a There is no partnership concept as person.\nIt's always\n\n@22:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthe vendor customer relationship, right?\n\n@22:03 - Manish Sau\nHow much we say you are a partner to me, but ideally everybody sees everybody as a vendor or a customer that is how we can do it.\nIt's a very transactional relationship by design. Yuki is a result as a result. Adoption, slow rhega, sometime to rhega until unless few big companies set few examples.\n\n@22:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI get your point. I get your point. So, in terms of, let's look inside, let's look inside words. Are we using gen AI for RHR interaction, support, right, or other features other than core development, right?\nAt this point of time, no, because there are two big reasons.\n\n@22:52 - Manish Sau\nOne is, as of now, we are not cracked PLG. So, we are in SLG, high touch sales driven organization as of now.\nfor high touch sales driven organization meets and it has to be manual you cannot replace if you crack the LG then it's a different story altogether but as of today we are in a sales driven company number two I want to crack voice for calling I won't crack voice but I have not tried it yet I have not tried it yet maybe down the line six to nine months I will try it when I have to do a lot of calls yes that's that's it so HR we are a 789 people team so as a result we do not need a lot of HR use cases finance with the transaction we need I keep financially up for our support support we have customer support that we have to provide once you have to provide customer support at scale we are not providing I we will be using it\n\n@24:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbecause the cost of support will go down yeah of course now few questions where I would love to know your opinion right so number one let us assume that you know what you know today okay but you are sent one year back what would you do differently I would have taken much a use case first approach as compared to a technology first approach okay in hindsight when you look back at all this work that you have done what do you think was the hardest for the most difficult hurdle in implementing\n\n@26:00 - Manish Sau\nMCP can be hard, it can be hard.\n\n@26:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMCP is coming in, but to sit by the guidance, there were many earlier that they had built-up. But MCP was the next layer to it.\n\n@26:11 - Manish Sau\nBut Oscar Family Aid, MCP Nathan, it's a piano. Aid, not a problem. Family Aid, it's just a salt piano.\nPeople know this. It's an old problem. It's not something new. It's an old problem and it has been solved with an engineering client-friendly approach.\n\n@26:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nUnderstood. Understood. So, you think the biggest problem so far was in the way that engineers used to handle code or AI.\nFunctions, more than code functions can be handled over.\n\n@26:51 - Manish Sau\nIf there are functions to handle coding against it.\n\n@26:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEverything you can actually club will do, if you are with it.\n\n@27:00 - Manish Sau\nGood engineering practice, you can club everything into a being a function ideal. Let's say that we have problem solver that we can handle functions.\n\n@27:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nyou think still, I mean, there's no other problem that's like hallucination to hey, language models, the hallucination of all the problem needs to be solved.\n\n@27:19 - Manish Sau\nsecurity of all the problem needs to be solved. There are a lot of areas that needs to be solved.\nBut there is work that is being done. We need deployment, which was difficult, like your back is easier today.\nSo there has been a lot of changes that have happened. The last year to today, we have actually seen a lot of things coming in, which is helping the final outcome.\nyes, there are a lot of white spaces that say that trailing needs to be improved. Explainability needs to improve.\nExplainability is still now, even with the best of the best framework that is available, explainability still is limited by design, auditability is real limited by design.\nLLM experimental is limited by design. So, and specially, you need explainability from the ETL point of view. Javapni embedding generate Kia, Mahasya Akka explainability should go on and say if you go embedding in the wrong way to buy whatsoever we are doing, are backtracking.\nAnd we are adding a post career model with few models that you check out. How can we do that?\nSo, fundamentally we are going to step back to actually solve something which is two steps back. Yes, he is a solid only child, is a solid only child, is governance solid only child, he is still is a big, big, big problem.\n\n@28:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOr specific into governance? What, what would probably be for seeing the one answer? data movement primary.\n\n@29:00 - Manish Sau\ndata movement, speed, data movement and data movement. There is this company called Sellesteal I know I think you might have thought it.\nSellesteal they just say data movement, theoretically have it the project here.\n\n@29:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat is great if they can achieve it. I don't know what they have achieved, will know what they can achieve at that scale and with that precision what they are promising, it will be a groundbreaking thing across the because it's actually, is that going to be a problem or maybe a right and the next would be what is your biggest revelation you have seen all this right yeah as I just see something that you were able to just be surprised or learning what is your biggest\nthing that has uncovered been uncovered for you in the journey.\n\n@30:03 - Manish Sau\nWhen we started this journey now, we were for three, four months. We were trying our old traditional coding processes or coding practices which actually doesn't work in NLMs.\nEntire practice is different. It's a completely new paradigm to approach engineering only, forget functionality. Engineering only has to be approached in a very different way because the thing that we are dealing with is very, very smart.\nAnd whatsoever we have done from an engineering perspective has always been very, very dumb by design. We have made it smart first, we have executed something on top of it.\nBut in this case it was a wait for three, four months we struggled to figure out the practice. the most use of this particular technology.\nSo this was a big revelation for us. You have approached Kavana Chai.\n\n@31:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, right. And let's say last question is what is your recommendation for companies? one thing to get into gen AI and use it for this transformation?\nWhat do you think is your opinion, where you tell them, what is the type that I'm looking at?\n\n@31:42 - Manish Sau\nStart-up side optimize everything. Every layer of your architecture has to be optimized. Otherwise, this entire thing, even if you deliver the functionality, will not, it will be not production rate.\nwill all be negaring a production. You have already put in so many things together. Not actually to take a summer summer summer summer summer.\nAs a subject when web app or a mobile app is very very difficult, but it's a different call game order.\nAnd as far as clients are concerned, you have to experiment. Have to be open to experimentation. And you have to know use cases.\nThese no use cases. The hahahm nuk pahile trigra nachate. So for example, if you are a factory, don't try to get into autonomous factories from day one.\nIf you don't walk out. First, find out the lowest hanging fruit from there you go to an autonomous factory kind of a use case.\nDon't make big jumps physically. Knowing the end goal, because nobody knows what is your internal capabilities. If you are just wondering your internal capabilities and you do not have an AI strategy in place, you will not be able to achieve something like an autonomous factory.\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nAI Infra - Exec Orchestartion\nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\n8pm 40L \nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\nLot\nCopyWriting 0 whitepaper / Preresenation / collateral - WhitePaper/Presentation - Presentation\nTime 10X\nCode Review / Debugging - Not coding\nTime 10X\nBrain Storming\n10X\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nCost of Inference - Affecting $ Value - ROI\n\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nSales Accross Geog\nOn Prem Runtimes - ROI get better - compressing runtime - \nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nPlacement Engine\nEducation of Market\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.

        "content": "Transcript\nDipendar | Vicky Interview - July 04\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 51 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHey, I'm good.\n\n@0:07 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nHow about you, Vicki? Good, man.\n\n@0:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you for joining this. It's a big, big thing. I love the idea of it. Vicki is a good, good idea.\nYeah, I mean, Vicki is simply means as a kid. So it's a kid's bank that I'm building it across here.\nAnd I mean, is it very, is it something that kids can use? would love my daughter to explore it.\n\n@0:32 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nAs of now, there are articles that have published on my LinkedIn channel and LinkedIn page, basically.\n\n@0:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd the app is under testing. know, we are just removing out the final bugs.\n\n@0:42 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo first version should be out in next 15 days. You should use my daughter as a testing. Yeah, yeah.\n\n@0:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI can.\n\n@0:48 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI can share you the copy. mean, then I'll share you the AP game and you can install and, you know, that is hard.\n\n@0:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI can, I can offer her as a testing tool for you. She will, she will\n\n@1:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo, the app is where you will also be involved, how old is your kid?\n\n@1:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMy daughter is 12. Okay, so my daughter is 12 too, but they have crossed certain limits.\n\n@1:12 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nthis Picnabank starts with the age of 4.\n\n@1:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, the age that I have quantified for the tool is 418. So, she is somewhere in between, I am not saying that she is not, but this tranche is under development and this will be launched somewhere around the valley.\n\n@1:31 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nOkay, so I will share, you still, I will share the access and then, you know, you can definitely explore it together.\n\n@1:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, but counter in any ways because I am really excited about the idea, this is great. So, this would be like education industry, right?\n\n@1:45 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nThis is education industry, yeah. 5 to 17 is the age factor, but this is a financial literacy that I am going to reach to the kids.\n\n@1:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut trust me, the method that we are using, even the, know, to use it as a kid. they say that you know it's like this is coming up so beautiful you know the ones like the ones who with whom I have run this MVP they were so excited they said I mean come on we'll please enroll us as a kid you know you really want some some someone like you to mentor us you know as a some kind which is actually awesome yeah say have you seen the the LinkedIn page what I've built across for the tool you know we are publishing content there I have not seen the LinkedIn nobody's I'll share it I'll share it with you later maybe you know and you can share it with your daughter as well maybe she can go through the articles and how she's feeling about it you can definitely let me know perfect I would love that and I mean there's a link to the blog on the site why don't you link the LinkedIn page to the blog link at least somebody will reach there yeah I mean so for so the there is a central repository you know that that EPA was not working so\nSo eventually LinkedIn and side block will pick up from that API only. mean, that's how it would be. Okay, that's good.\nSo I mean, I think LinkedIn is a good enough block. So if you can probably have a page where you can directly into LinkedIn, block will be good.\nIt's really nice. Okay. Great. So I shared a list of questions with you. And this you can answer in capacity for me or other organizations you might have read earlier.\nThat is okay with you.\n\n@3:35 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYeah, I mean, I'll definitely do that.\n\n@3:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo you have WhatsApp me the list. What's happening? I mean, she still share it again with you. Give me a second.\nI'm gonna share share. Yeah, I shared this in the WhatsApp message. Again, but here is the means again on chat.\nYeah, it should be with you. Yeah, I have just opened it across.\n\n@4:13 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYeah.\n\n@4:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, surely. Yeah, so the idea is to understand, hey, I mean, basically two questions, right? And all these will feed it into those two questions, which is number one, generative AI came in big, they come there, not sure, right?\nWhat I've been explored, what I've been tried, what was successful, what was not successful, our learnings are understanding of what generative AI has done so far for us, that's one.\n\n@4:47 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSurely.\n\n@4:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe second one is that we understand that, hey, it's not great right now, but it will be a great future.\nAnd most in mind, what is the aspiration we have in a longer term from these tools. Right? Where upcoming, let him probably she may not be covered as a community.\nSo I would like to explore it first. So these are the two major things that I am focusing on.\nAnd all these questions will basically fit into the door and populate.\n\n@5:14 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSurely.\n\n@5:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSurely.\n\n@5:16 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nDoes it make sense?\n\n@5:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, Absolutely.\n\n@5:20 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo, What is the stage of the company right at the seed stage from what I am saying? Yes.\n\n@5:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYes. And what would be the size right now? Right now we are a four employee company. mean, and like we are just onboarding queue interns, maybe couple of interns.\n\n@5:39 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nThat's more of it.\n\n@5:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRest are all contractual, you know, coders that we are taking onboard. And having put up some seed funds and all too far?\n\n@5:49 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nNot exactly.\n\n@5:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, it's like I never wanted somebody to interrupt the idea.\n\n@5:53 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nknow the first idea that I'm bringing on the table.\n\n@5:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo once the idea is formulated, am able to showcase that tool to the investors.\n\n@6:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nknow,\n\n@6:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'll start, you know, I'm just going invest on both. that makes a lot of sense. So, is the EI adoption level in the company that you're envisioning and offering that going across?\nSo, well, I've used AI in past.\n\n@6:15 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nAnd in this current organization, first of all, the LinkedIn page that you'll see across it is all or sure it is all AI.\nSo marketing and this is marketing.\n\n@6:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nDigital marketing is all AI for sure. That's a currently used case. And even the learnings for us also, you know, in terms of how things have evolved over time, this air brings us the concrete in crisp information rather than, you know, we Google it around or research tool.\nIt's it is something which is helping you expedite your research very fast. I'm going to be using for that.\nI'm using charge if you did direct or tools like public city, which I really great at this class. No, I mean, I'm I'm using Bing Co pilot.\n\n@6:57 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI'm using GPT three, GPT four. So and I've recently started using Gemini from Google and of course for for for for pictures maybe 4.ai stable that stable diffusion there are tools and even for the video content creation that we are creating you know as we launch app we will be coming up with the videos so that is also being created by AI.\n\n@7:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I mean are you using Dali also or only as the I think I mean I'm not aware on what Dali and.\nDali is from Jai GPT. You make the data from GPT. You have standard diffusion which probably you are using right now.\nYes, stable diffusion. Stable diffusion is something that we are using and 4.ai that's an Indian startup 4.ai Ph O T dot A I am liking it.\n\n@8:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nmean the\n\n@8:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nway i describe the how image should pop up you know it is bringing me the image out of i don't know where and and it is exactly you know fitting in the content so i mean my i mean basically my digital marketing is something that that budget is safe for for quite a good time now that's awesome that's that's great and this concurs with others also have done the interview for them also they still marketing the biggest place where this has given them a lot of benefits yes and video generation why are you using the video generation is something because otherwise if i look at the the other you know the the content creators basically when i reach out to them for creating a three four minute video know they're charging humongous yeah so the video which is coming up from ai there is a a tool to refine that tool you know the refine that video so\n\n@9:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nIf you develop little skills, know, the time is less, the money is less, why not?\n\n@9:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, that's the best part that you guys bring in.\n\n@9:09 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo we see the exorbitant amount that, you know, the industry was charging for little efforts.\n\n@9:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAI is bringing it to the root cause, like, you know, this is something you should charge and if you are charging more, then, you know, they will come and come to me.\n\n@9:25 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nknow, that's what AI has come up with.\n\n@9:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely. what tools? mean, just to if you are okay with sharing, know, I are you using? There is a complete list of tools, you know, I just cannot list out all the tools.\nThere is a library with me.\n\n@9:40 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI'll share with you the summary of, you know, the tools that I'm using, you know, sometimes for the music generation, if you want to create a song, it's, know, dot AI, you know, know.\n\n@9:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, we are trying experimenting a lot of things around.\n\n@9:53 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI'll share with the complete list maybe after the call, know. That is awesome. That can be awesome.\n\n@9:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, there are a lot of people who have been... using things like synchasia or bid human digital humans for actual conversations we are even going to the levels where you can have whom calls using AI with your script yes right and i mean they think we have 10 000 calls per minute that they can do poor calls and cold calls are like something just like money drainers or yeah yes yes yes very good direction yeah so that's one thing and uh yeah this is this is where you know we have used AI till now and the R&D which is going on is is a lot with AI we are building a complete chatbot based out of AI so that any user who is popping in what is there in the tool what is it helping you out how it is strategically helping parents to you know help their kids achieve the good financial literacy and financial acumen and all around and so basically it is it is a one one\nWhat I can say? Consolidated guide for parents as well as for students and it is also back with the information based on AI world.\n\n@11:10 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo firstly, it is searching out the tool and tool capabilities, tool things itself and then if in case it is unable to find then it goes out and pops up that I am going to bring it from the internet world, are you okay to do that?\nwe are not disclosing it to student and kids community because if in case it pops up something like a malign image or some stuff, that is like a breach of policy which is for mandatory for kids, if you look at the US, COPA is there, so COPA is something which is taken very seriously in US and you cannot just disclose anything which is explicit.\n\n@11:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo basically I am not pushing any. internet content to kids because it may not be filtered properly but yes for for adults we are definitely putting that AI-based chatbot which is awesome and the chatbot is the main driving the workflow of learning is it being driven by the chatbot or we have a separate logic for the driving of the workflow.\n\n@12:21 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nso basically there is a framework that we have set across initially it's like kase kase karnan then just for setting up a profile and everything and then it starts learning you know how kids are behaving how kids how parents are granting them tasks or how how kids are planning to or how kids are doing the progressively investing and how kids behavior is coming out to be so there is a complete cognitive behavior tool which is at a backend which will work so accordingly the recommendations will pop up to kids that you can you can reverse your investment how what are the advantages where is the risk mitigation how so there is a complete ladder which\n\n@13:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nis which will follow through.\n\n@13:01 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo right now it is in built up and I'm sure it will be very fruitful when it pops up near Diwali with the second phase of the world.\n\n@13:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm sure, I'm sure. That's the reason I offered another test for you. So in terms of the company's strategic goal right, this is we are still building framework and all will be coming up and stuff.\nright now from what I understand, generative AI is being used only in the chatbot because the rest is more like staffing data and you are using of a live platform probably.\nNo, there is there is so it's cognitive behavior is also where you know we are using this chatbot. Okay, no chatbot AI basically because it's like a trained psychiatrist which is coming up to help us without you know without actual involvement.\nI really agree. So that's the beauty of AI, know, the profile that you want, I mean, at least 80% profit and profile is available.\n\n@14:07 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo definitely you have to give them a edge, okay, it is like something which is not evolving very fast.\nI guess AI is doing wonders, you know, when you say about 80% profit and people. So I can ask AI to, you know, come up and replace any 80% profit and person, yes, like IT is evolving very fast, react and I mean the IT, like if in case I want to ask AI for LLM deployment in my organization, I'm sure it will fail at few nitty-grits because it is evolving very fast, you know, that is why, you know, that is something which we are deploying our own rest of the things.\n\n@14:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nso chatbot is one that I understood, cognitive behavior, understanding is the second one. Yeah, development also you are using this already, also seeing it right now, not exactly out.\nSo, backend is something which is under our control where we are integrating this AI, but the front end, you know, the front end which is getting developed, that is something the first phase which is already signed off.\n\n@15:11 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo, right now the first phase which is getting launched, so, yeah, that is being known for that.\n\n@15:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nDevelopment, using some generative AI, mean, could co-pilot or I mean other tools which are using code.\n\n@15:24 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYeah, that is what I am saying, that that co-pilot being co-pilot.\n\n@15:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, this is the start and I mean, as you move on, what is this strategically moving on, other than the transport and probably the vehicle which is continuing of course and standing.\n\n@15:46 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nAnalytics, I mean, for that matter, right now we do not have a bandwidth, but analytics is something which we will definitely use, you know, AI, because it has, AI has much more knowledge than what I may be having, know, maybe there.\ntheir dashboards for a app performance is something that investors like you know you give it to the AI like the AI dashboard which investors will like you know it'll give you the very good and from the operations standpoint it gives you the standard similar dashboard well that is something which we try to integrate across that's great so analytics is one strategic goal that you look at anything else in terms of operations or marketing or whatever there are many things you know the thing is we need to have time to like interact with AI like if in case I say a small thing like optimization even though even for the optimization sake like this is where we are you know I'll tell them that okay this is my current state and I want to optimize my operation like the storage that I'm like storage is something which is which is not a point of concern for me because right now I'm just launching the app with a with a good azure cloud storage but maybe you know tomorrow I want to have something\n\n@17:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nfor the for the storage optimization so I don't know means so there are areas which we have identified which we which we will touch upon as we progress this journey but yeah awesome awesome well I like the fact that you are focused on the fact that it's going to touch every area yeah yeah yeah absolutely I guess it is but then again you have to give it benefit of doubt that okay AI will be 80% proficient if you want 100% proficiency maybe you need to have really good expert so maybe you know the 80 the task that that I get it done you know maybe the 10 tasks that I've got done maybe I'll have an auditor or you know some expert to come and you know super wise how AI is performing what does the miss what is the miss from the ASI and then you know they can come as a consultant and give me the yarn and maybe go away you know that's all we have human in the new kind of strip yeah yeah yeah awesome and I mean if you look at the achievements\nprobably so far that we have done because we are almost near an MVP and in your past life with other organizations that we have worked with and done, what do you are the main achievements, right?\nIn various media technology, every people management, every data management, managing of processes, operations, what do you think that has been able to achieve?\nmean you have been able to achieve out of the database so far in these different areas.\n\n@18:26 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI guess one of the beautiful things, in my previous two stints, last one was World Trade Center and prior to that I was heading IT for H&M, right?\n\n@18:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nH&M retail.\n\n@18:38 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nin H&M retail, we did a good pilot.\n\n@18:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt was like influencing customer behavior, know, if some customer has touched upon some particular set of garments, we will run some videos across in store or, you know, if that can be extended to the mall also, which will be a kind of similar, you know, similar what,\n\n@19:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\ngroup, someone is wearing and you know moving in hills or gardens or something.\n\n@19:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that somebody who picked up that particular set of comment is getting influenced like about the beauty of the farm.\n\n@19:10 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nAnd so that was a very good pilot project that we run across in 2020, you know, using the first set of, but it was a, you know, breach of DVC.\n\n@19:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that is something that popped up and we had to scrap out that project, but it was a very good project and run beautifully.\n\n@19:31 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo one of the things which was, I mean, of course, H&M was Swedish origin company. again, GDPR compliant was something which was, you know, things of privacy actually popped up a big time.\nSo we have to scrap out that, but that code was there. was a successful project, but it was being shut down due to some other reason.\n\n@19:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd so this is basically in terms of customer management, right? Customer in management, yeah. the\n\n@20:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nThe SKUs that you have the wardrobe that you have displayed on the store is something where customers are moving more of an area.\n\n@20:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou analyze that and then accordingly you give it to a warehouse, this kind of garments are expecting a high level of purchase during this, so maybe you can, maybe something that needs to go to the Bombay.\n\n@20:21 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nMaybe you can line up the transit right now because it will get two to four days, especially in the monsoon season or something.\n\n@20:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that was a good run-through that we had with this. Some of those discussions, a very good friend of mine, Selva was leading H&M.\nWas it Sylvan? Yeah, he is a very good friend of mine, his family friend. Okay. shared some of these with me and was coming back with this, this is human foot, right?\nYeah, yeah, This was in terms of operation, right? In terms of technology, since you were publishing on that, but he was using something, you more deeper in terms of technology as, as\nthe development side of things? I mean in in WTC we have done across lot of things but when you talk about the AI thing no that was not touched upon during in WTC because real estate law is something which is again very great and the information there is is kind of very very confidential across so that was something which we which hampered you know the use of AI but yes we developed technology technology in there I guess we were like one of first few you know real estate developers who brought out some very good connect connects with car customers when you look at the customer base we had some very good platforms even the teams or something you know so something which was extended to the customer base was quite high thus that's great and we didn't use much generally in terms of development of that but yeah in terms of usage we were using it\n\n@22:01 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nNot even in terms of usage because even a minor mess was going to impact a lot, so in real estate, the ticket size is very high.\nyou look at the single sale or something, the ticket size is very high, so we cannot afford that mess.\nlooking at the value proposition, it was coming up, so all the draft which was going, it has very good stages.\n\n@22:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nEven the marketing content, firstly it will be marketing, it will be legal, it will be radar.\n\n@22:33 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nThe workflow was defined in a way that the single mix could cost a fortune to the company.\n\n@22:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd since due to the 80% size that you said, maybe this doesn't fit the...\n\n@22:47 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nNo. Because the ticket size was high, even for the 1% of the sale, if the ticket size was huge, it was going to cost a fortune.\n20% is too big.\n\n@23:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that is, that is the, I don't mean, that is, which is great, which is great.\nAnd in terms of culture, whether it be an H&M or in the real state, I mean, was there a difference in terms of culture and before deeper into these things, probably later down the line, but I mean, was there a sort of a culture in biting in terms, hey, I mean, everybody should use it and say time or he do not touch it because it's not was there some kind of a culture shift due to the way I had.\n\n@23:30 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo I guess it's about a progressive mindset and the, but somewhere, you know, somewhere down the lane, some, I mean, when I look at the H&M culture or the WTC culture, it's not more about the real estate and retail, it is more about the culture shift and the capping, which was coming up from the organization is something, okay, you can use AI, but then you have to publish your social handles or something on your personal capacity,\ntagging H&M.\n\n@24:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat was a clear guideline. So even if somebody has a good set of influencers sake, even the employees if they have one million forward, but they will say that in case you have to tag H&M or H&M has to run through some campaign with you, that needs to be looked upon from the various perspectives.\n\n@24:26 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nit's just not that. So the plane Vinita entry for AI for any aspect was also not allowed.\n\n@24:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo what I understood was that as I come, they wanted to promote it, but not publicly. They wanted to go try it out, but publicly by naming it.\n\n@24:42 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo basically from the back end perspective, for the e-commerce they've used AI a lot. When you look at the YML journey, you may also like something that you hover upon when you go to the Amazon or anywhere.\nSo basically if you go to H&M or Mintra because\n\n@25:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nH&M is also collaborated at Mintra.\n\n@25:02 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo when you go and hover around things, there were a lot of analytics which was going on there at the back end.\n\n@25:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nknow, like this customer is interested in these sort of articles or so that recommendation engine which was following up, but then not majority.\nYeah, but those identified members who are all based on ML&EI, not generativity. No, not just ML&EI. You're right.\n\n@25:27 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYou're right. That is something which was there. mean, generative AI is something which has a pretty club.\n\n@25:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, has to be as basic. Yeah. I was there till 2020. So I'm coming up till then. All right.\nThat's a good problem. And what about in terms of processes, right? So culture is one thing, but in terms of processes, normally I go, I write, then I get it verified by one of the, let's say, editors and then I publish, right?\n\n@25:59 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nMake or check.\n\n@26:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPeople change this kind of a process where they said, hey, you first do not write on your own. You first ask CloudDBD for ideas, then you build up on those ideas, then you run another AI, which validates your what we have written, and then you will do the written.\nYou'll save a little Stein, right? So this kind of things, these kind of process changes are common, something that you have noticed or you have pushed or things are happening in your world.\n\n@26:26 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nFor me, I have seen a lot of content developers are losing jobs.\n\n@26:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, that is what I have seen. People have started believing what GPT is producing is something which is already an eye opener for a lot of customers.\nmaybe GPT is a vast set of knowledge, which is not in the capacity of one, two or three individuals.\nonly thing is you have to have a good prompt that's what it is poking up.\n\n@26:53 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo if in case you are able to get fed something good out of GPT, you know, of course you are able to showcase.\nmean, if you are going to ask those or\n\n@27:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you are going to fetch the limited set of queries, of course, you're going to get limited results, but so that's why, you know, people have started using consulting or maybe, you know, outsourcing this has been the best part.\nonly thing is after GPTs, the outsource part is also costing you less of the fortune, that is what it is.\nThat's correct, that's correct.\n\n@27:43 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo, this regulation is something which is discussed upon. So, in middle of that, know, sometimes we get a prompt like, okay, let's plot these GPT things.\nSo, what I as an IT, I mean, or IT head, I can do is, like blocking out all the communication channels through this but then people have a mobile you know in the in the world we are talking BYOD you know we are asking them to stop like or refraining something at the laptop level or something people have a lot of devices you know we are so getting it refrained completely simply not possible that's what i have told them the only thing is the use case or the prompt that you are saying maybe you know if i read out on their laptop okay this is what user is doing i can give them a feedback this is something which you are not supposed to put across and maybe i can refrain it you know from publishing it over it deeply or something that is what i could do that's the policy that we implemented across like few keywords if in case that has been popped up on on any of the sites that will be refrained across you know but no no no no not not not at this time there are no tools available i mean for sure they claim to have you but even case i go for the use cases the everybody is saying that you know it\n\n@29:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nsaid we are still working on this test case, we are still working on this test case, there are no exact rules available for the governance, right, industry, right.\nSo, in this, this gives a lot of information in terms of people, let's focus on the people's head of things, mean, what we doing something to internally, let's say, I mean, I can not make my internal employees more happy or how can I ascertain better what they are doing or anything on the people's side of things that we do.\nI do a lot could be done, but I didn't get challenged, know, collaborate with HR on that part.\n\n@29:43 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nMaybe, you know, the HR is something, you know, who really don't like me, may be as a person. It's not just one or two months, you know, before the present, it's like every, every time of the year, they are, no, I'm not in their happy, happy, happy goalies.\n\n@30:01 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut yes, a lot could be done. lot of things were proposed by me to HR, but of course, never been encouraged across.\n\n@30:10 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nThey were like always pushing for the other task or something that is still lined up. Perfect.\n\n@30:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThat gives us insight into this. And if we look at it from the future plan perspective side of things.\nNow, let us say you are still there and in these two companies that we talked about and other things that you thought were in your past.\nAnd it's a good start that HR is one area you would like to put in your future plan. What the areas you would like to put in your future plans?\n\n@30:43 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI guess for any, like if in case I am expanding anywhere, maybe if I expand any area anywhere.\n\n@30:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, the first team setup is something I look forward for AI only, the base profile.\n\n@30:57 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nIf in case I have to go to or maybe I penetrate different geography like you. Europe, Africa, Latin. So first thing I will do is the compliance check that will follow it will pop up from AI only you know.\nThen there are other set of queries which may pop up and then maybe I will reach out to somewhere of the big force okay these are like the set of queries that you need to suffice across period.\nIt is and the count will be maybe one tenth or one twentieth of you know which will be if in comparison to conventional engagement.\n\n@31:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo I mean if I go upon in any of the areas across AI has got a very good set of information for a different geography you know especially when you are looking for the multi-geography penetration.\n\n@31:39 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI guess AI would be the first one to look for because you don't have idea about any geography you know what what is there in Latin you know how they are managing the across or what are the things that people are up to if you have to market across what is a trending pattern there you know how can I relate to the kids and there is there.\nSo there are a lot of things that we have experimented here. here in India, mean, and using that, you know, will definitely go across with the first set of things with the AI and then maybe another expansion, but the expansions which have, which have happened conventionally, I've seen X&M expansion across geographies.\n\n@32:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis expansion of my own app is going to be far more less than what, you know, the environment which was, which has been the part of conventional plan, like 100 people, 200 people, it's not like it, maybe 10 people, 12 people is sufficient enough to run a country, I would say.\nYeah, it should have been a beast, remember, they see and they're running across different parts of India, and a lot of things, both the boys were in Delhi and they had to all this, but with the app, it's good that you can operate from one place and you can manage it with the other.\nThat's a different way, yeah, but sometimes, I mean, there's like a brick and mortar model for H&M, but I guess, the e-commerce has picked up really well.\nand they can minimize some staff at an e-commerce or minteral level let's just up to them I mean they are the ones who are actually planning it out but yes we can motor is something which is not that much in control but everything has their pros and cons that is their part of strategy and I believe it now that brings me to a very interesting question the question is I have these 10 or employees who are already there right and out of them five might be thinking yeah yeah yeah maybe not we try or five might be thinking yeah this is 80% and 20% of time I don't know what to move right and there might be so many other four partners and etc how do you see that a existing team and getting this in terms of people what should I do do I blame them should I just check out people who do not seem to be getting on the bandwagon but this is something that that's futuristic what we have to do right I mean I love the fact and I put it somewhere\nor the other, first thing to set up should be the AIT, right, which is the way we putting it.\nSo, I guess the people who have been there in system for quite a long time, I guess they should actually encash that skill, you know, and take their skills to the next level.\nBasically, they should come up saying, okay, this is what, you know, this is a use case of AI, where AI is giving me the inputs and the way consultants, you know, the way we use to engage consultant is something that I can save out the cost.\n\n@34:28 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nAnd as an expert, I can tell you there is a caveat of the output, which is coming up from AI, this is where, you know, we may fall prey.\nSo, maybe, you know, we can come up with something as a foolproof solution, you know, I have an idea.\n\n@34:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd so, that is how, you know, employees should evolve with solution. Of course, if they simply give up on, you know, AI thing, of course, they need to find a place for themselves.\nYeah. So, I mean, we would probably prefer to coach them, or you would prefer to, mean, how do you put this across?\nSo, first, see, I cannot quote my father, you to say one beautiful thing, know, you cannot bring, you can bring horse to water, you cannot make him drink.\nSo, so I can, I can tell them, you know, what is the best path forward for them? And even if they don't agree to like jump from or like move even few steps, then of course, I cannot tell them out, you know, to the, to the core, I can give them direction.\n\n@35:19 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nThey have to show some set of efforts where they are putting in, and if they're missing their efforts in some particular direction, I am no expert, but I can plan to evolve, you know, they're journey along with them.\n\n@35:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, and if on the percentage of 0 to 100, you would say getting on this bandwagon is 100% critical.\n\n@35:39 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYeah.\n\n@35:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, I can give a leader of 20% and if you are not on it, I would still probably continue.\nBecause I have support the leaders would say, Hey, this is 100% important for me right now, because if you are not on the bandwagon, then you are actually making a gap in my company, which thing will get into those inputs, right?\nYeah.\n\n@35:57 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nthat is what I say. mean, if somebody's not getting on board with the, with the, Yes, of course, they need to find place for themselves that as simple as that.\n\n@36:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. Great. That's that's that's good. And I mean, looking at the hindsight, now, these are things that have happened that you have commented on that.\nlooking at the hindsight, what do you think what you were the biggest hurdle? have this cute person gets in the glue in terms of generating AI or having people getting into generative AI or do things on generative.\nSo, I don't know, I mean, because I was even even as a C2, know, I was bringing a lot of things to the table when I was with real estate, even prior to that.\n\n@36:41 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo sometimes the port doesn't agree, know, because they are not for mindset that, you know, there's something which cannot be evolved, you know, it's not like, this is the conventional way of doing it and we'll do it the same way, know, the poor one.\nSo, sometimes you cannot break through their mindset, that's one of the obstacles. that's the biggest obstacle that I actually encounter and then when you look at and when I look at the problem sake the problem that I am if I have faced I don't know maybe use of AI something which we are doing now only you know when when we are building up our normalization yeah privacy was one that you mentioned yeah privacy is something but you know the the again the bot thing which we were building up it was popping up lot of the content which was no way relevant so we have a refrain to roll it out at this particular launch part and we are we we understood that it needs optimization you know before we actually roll it out for the that's what we don't want to spoil UX by any means you know rather than contributing to the value of the app it was not actually I mean it was giving the vague answers which was no way relevant so so that's why we refrained it from the from the launch site and we said okay let it get mature let's roll it out with Facebook that's how it is\n\n@38:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm not extensively in that domain, right? If you are aware of alpha school, I don't know if are aware of GE school, right, either.\nThis is where we have developed the future of education apps for dreams. Okay. You're even, I mean, if you're aware of Khan Academy, can we go?\nYeah, yeah, It's one of our competitors, right? Okay. that's the place. mean, there are a lot of things which we have done there, which might help you out on this.\nACTION ITEM: Reach out to Pickney Bank with questions regarding education apps - WATCH\nSo if you have questions, I think just push it up to be my right way to do it. Sure, why not?\n\n@38:32 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nWhy not?\n\n@38:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere are lot of things.\n\n@38:34 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nWe are building up our school modules now, something which could be rolled out in school. And I guess there will be a lot of portions.\n\n@38:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthat you have told me that you are from, I mean, have worked in education and I'll definitely reach out to you.\nThere are a lot of things. I mean, there are a lot of places where I get stuck and then, you know, if I know somebody has an idea.\n\n@38:55 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nAnything. Anything.\n\n@38:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIf you have me on WhatsApp, just pick me up.\n\n@38:59 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSurely. meeting across right on 14th, right?\n\n@39:02 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Anytime. On 14th, are meeting anyways.\n\n@39:07 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYeah.\n\n@39:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd then we are taking it from 11th. So, continuing with this, we have very less time left. What is the most notable success in all this that you have done?\nAnd you would say, it's like best that has happened. No, not exactly.\n\n@39:25 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nmean, it is too early to say something on those lines.\n\n@39:29 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou know, key AC, yes.\n\n@39:31 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo, other thing is, when I look at the digital thing, know, digital marketing I planed the budget of almost like 1.5 to 2 lakh for the spent, when we loan.\nACTION ITEM: Share lists of useful AI tools (including audio/video tools for student talk) with examples and usage details with Vicky Biswas - WATCH\nThat is something that is saved. know, AI has saved.\n\n@39:48 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd if you continue to go like this, I guess there will be a lot that AI can save across.\n\n@39:54 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nme, right now, those, Karimmen is just popping up like, like any heart, know, that is something\n\n@40:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwhich will take time because firstly it is about my trust you know which is getting developed on AI okay can I can it lead any area without any visionary thing or so firstly develop that level of trust and then you know the engagement will follow for sure right right this is something which will probably just change I make a lot of sense and that trust is not going to be sometimes you know that 20% is like it that stakes are too high on that 20% you know so that is that is something I mean I'm sure it will get mature with time the way AI is prompting you know the the way it is learning the way people have started using it it will mature for sure very fast very rapidly but till that time you know we really need to keep a check on the output which we are which we are receiving from AI I mean\nAnd then you know I can share this with you. We have even filed patent for creating books living here.\nAnd I have been able to create an entire book that a student can use with images, questions, with everything in it, right?\nAnd this is for 1811, right? So you can imagine the amount that it has there, but who still need a human in the room?\nBecause at 20%, we were able to correct it down to 95%. But even after that, you still need it because 5% cannot have kids going into that 5% room.\nIt's a career, it's a life, that's a state, right? They can't spend there. that's probably what it is learning for me.\nOK.\n\n@41:42 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nLike when you were with alpha or, can't work for the IP learner profile.\n\n@41:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou know IP learner profile?\n\n@41:55 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo there are CVS schools, there are IB schools, right? So IB schools have IB learner profile. file for all the kids.\nSo, why any chance have you got something to work in a way that how the kids are performing based out of performance and that is mapped to the IB learner profile or something.\n\n@42:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMy focus was entirely in US. We have poor standards and we are US standards. So our focus was entirely there and the profiling that we were building there was to be based on that.\nIB was not something that we focused on.\n\n@42:28 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nSo, what is their standard? What is their standard in US?\n\n@42:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThey are using Common Core. They are using NDSS. are multiple standards that they are utilizing there. Common Core is one of the most used.\nNDSS is one of the most used. These are the most common. If you would see NDSS and Common Core, would probably be able to get there.\nOkay. But if you have some questions regarding the profile, if you give me some details, maybe I am able to share my thoughts about it.\nDefinitely connect with you.\n\n@43:01 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI'll definitely connect with you because the cognitive behavior that we are doing I'm sure it is the same behavior across all your face It's just that it needs to be translated to their own language like their own standard or something so that kids and parents can relate to that That is not only that.\n\n@43:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere's a huge requirement of guardrails On those because I mean I have had kids talking to the what I'm saying.\nHey Is it short of any frame Friday night with studies now scoot your maras men Right and No, no, for every question you get an answer of no for 15, but will the chatbot do Right, yeah, yeah, so it is completed because We are dealing with humans which can be totally irrational or to be out of what is expecting as an equal to your system Right, so those large ways are so critical to manage them and to get into regimen We have had to build things like this Okay, I want to go play football\nyes football is great but you see when you kick the football the angle is this and this is what we were studying angle is this much right and you bring back the people into the conversation it was like phenomenally not easy yeah so yeah there's some other challenges what way your elevation your learning is in terms of building all this one of them I understand is maturity right it's still not there great but what else I mean anything else that you think is a elevation but from learning that you have by dealing with all these things I guess what I've learned across it is something that AI has really emerged big time you know I mean the kind of skill set that we even imagine is something which is available in AI you know maybe if I have to hire some psychiatrists based out of UK so I really need not hire somebody you know I can firstly go to the thing and I ask them to like well you just just prompt me like a UK psychiatrist child\n\n@45:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nand then answer this question. the forms that I get from the GPT or even copilot, it's really relevant.\n\n@45:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it gives me the idea at least to plan out things and then of course it may have some slippages but that slippages are too thin because psychiatry is something which has not evolved so high over period of time.\nWe had the same because universities and PhDs and probably professional courses keep changing a lot but school content has been like same courageous.\nI can't say that it's not there and this is not only for India this is all over the daughter is doing her Cambridge this is seen right right right right but after picnic if in case you know they get integrated with\n\n@46:00 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nIt's going to bring up a lot of fun, you know, that's how it is. So let's see, that was difficult.\n\n@46:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI had a small startup where we were handling news, right, news tokens and there was a huge resistance in terms of schools trying to get this to students because if the students would it into a space, right, the parents do not take it well.\nIf you try to Google the students directly, you won't get that bulk that you're trying to get to the school at the school level and say that you should apply.\nACTION ITEM: Share financial literacy plans with Vicky Biswas - WATCH\n\n@46:35 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nI'll definitely let you know about the financial plans that I have across for this because financial literacy is a big shout, you know, right now.\n\n@46:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd there is a complete penetration strategy that I have brought across maybe, I don't know if you just crossed maybe, you love it because I am the first person here, I mean, I might always in, I mean, you want to test, test, I have no problem with that, right?\nthat in U.S. my last visit to U.S. I had a very deep discussion with you in the future and these people told me that these are things that U.S.\nis definitely looking at things like financial interest, financial interest. politics should be there and there is nothing in the schools right even in the extra categories which are actually going deep into it.\nSo this is the university or gold mine and this is very, good. Thank you, thank you. I have a question I have already got answered and that is do you have a opinion on generating super helpful or not helpful at all.\nMy last question is that what would be a recommendation for companies who are trying to get digital transformation that will be generated by you.\nWhat is your recommendation for me? I guess it is expedite the process for sure because it has it not just about the ideas it has a lot of info you know where they can bring in but again for the digital transformation that the companies are going you know it's like they really need to have some use case studies in between and they really need to engage experts also because the journey is among the complete chain which they need to roll out so Jenny I can give them ideas then they have to have humans you know for planning it out on a on a practical level and then again back to the Jenny I for you know using the back and work or like the pushing the things and then of course humans to roll it out so what I understand is that here you can use it for everything but keep humans moving so that more than exactly and sure engage experts for you can right engage experts as for the for the expertise sake yeah perfect and you know that the one line that that really hits out as the star of this conversation that I've had with you and that is\nAI should be your first department that you set up and run this across and that's something I would really love to use with others and tell them it.\nI mean this is what I heard.\n\n@49:11 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nYes, yes, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n@49:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThere are use cases that I've studied across in every domain, every area of the organization. So why not?\n\n@49:21 - Pickney Bank (Pickney Bank)\nWhy not to practically use it?\n\n@49:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI don't let that knowledge remain in books only for the sake of being there. I really need to implement it across and try it across.\nACTION ITEM: Follow LinkedIn page 'Pickney Bank' shared by Pickney Bank - WATCH\nEven if it has to fail, it has to fail fast.

        "content": "Transcription\nImpromptu Google Meet Meeting - March 09\n\nVIEW RECORDING - 715 mins (No highlights)\n\n\n@0:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, how are you finally? Hey, finally, oh, sir, Casio.\n\n@0:07 - Amitoj Cheema\nVery cool, buddy.\n\n@0:08 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nman. Casio, I'm not going I mean, it's already, I'm coming.\n\n@0:12 - Amitoj Cheema\nWhatever you want to call is fine.\n\n@0:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTima works better. mean, though he works better, works better.\n\n@0:18 - Amitoj Cheema\nI see you guys are here. See you guys are here. Buddy, yeah.\n\n@0:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTima, thank you, for getting on this time.\n\n@0:28 - Amitoj Cheema\nIt was pending for some time. So yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n@0:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI was like a better electric key by busy vongashe, this company got away with a couple of them.\n\n@0:38 - Amitoj Cheema\nYeah, I didn't know what were saying.\n\n@0:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI didn't know. I didn't know what you were saying.\n\n@0:43 - Amitoj Cheema\nSomehow, you know, it just fell through the cracks. So we couldn't crack it.\n\n@0:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNo worries. Okay, good, good.\n\n@0:49 - Amitoj Cheema\nHow are you doing here? Not watching the match?\n\n@0:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'm good. to school.\n\n@0:54 - Amitoj Cheema\nNo, I don't know whether I'm going go finish line, Okay. wife is crazy about it.\n\n@1:04 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, I've been trying to get through a lot of people on this and my mother protects the mobile healthcare, okay?\nSo NAI has come in big time, right? So I've been doing a lot work lot work here, lot here, a lot work here, a lot work right?\nThe purpose of this research was key. Let's connect with around 200 CTOs and CEOs. And figure out from them key on ground, I'm going go get in a kitna fida tangibly di a tangibly katana I'm going to try and get like you know, naive by each other.\nSo they are storing it.\n\n@1:58 - Amitoj Cheema\nright.\n\n@1:59 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSure. Now, the thing is that we are trying to remove gen AI from the overall AI. So overall AI may have no models, not a look at regression, we are taking a small part of AI that is gen AI, be hyped, which is the diffusion models.\nSo that's the pretext. That's what we're trying to figure out. And we also want to put forward a recommendation, we'll also bring a plan second and get And we're try and test it.\nwe happy with that. They've got benefits from it, so they can also go ahead and use it.\n\n@2:42 - Amitoj Cheema\nI'm sure to take that. Make sense?\n\n@2:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nNow, I will divide this into two parts. It's a cohort question, it's general question. And then a free-filling from your side, on your opinions.\none will be totally based on key challenge possibly losses will go for the free-flowing where probably you can give your opinion or things to go right.\nSo before I begin this out, Mira Barima be a small snapshot. I work with technology. work with technology. work with technology.\nhave been managing technology for startups, for SMEs, for enterprises, either ways. So in general, I am a product kind of a guy, right.\nAnd being done this for a very, very long time, it's like mostly like a second nature where you just do this and it becomes a part of you.\nSo that's a really factor of being through with companies like Nama Office, ESW, the factory coordination, right.\n\n@4:00 - Amitoj Cheema\nYeah, how do you know already know couple is like through coordination?\n\n@4:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah couple Huh, we met we work together for defactory and coordination. How are you right, right?\n\n@4:13 - Amitoj Cheema\nOh my God.\n\n@4:14 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOh my God. So that's that's the pretext This is my background So questions member should go back to the cohort understand the next year.\nWhat industry and sector are currently in and what experience will you be sharing kiss industry like a sector set?\nGenerally, I've been coming up.\n\n@4:38 - Amitoj Cheema\nI've been in the AI for nearly 13 years now. I've been working on the AI model like your traditional way.\nbut if you want to like figure out, I mean working on what you call at tech, you know, basically technologies situations for\neducation for past three years. yeah, so that's you know more or less what we are that we are trying to create assistance for students, especially maths tutors for students that's the core of course by the proposition.\n\n@5:27 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, I will come to that question later because I've built it about three years back, we did it for companies like GD school, alpha school.\nOkay, so it will be a good conversation when you get into that. I think teams are like, I'll we will be bringing in some journey experience from before that or it's the I think.\n\n@6:10 - Amitoj Cheema\nIt's the January. September January. Twenty two, two separate generic.\n\n@6:16 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTwenty two, twenty one twenty two, seven, one, eight, eight, eight, eight, a like.\n\n@6:29 - Amitoj Cheema\nA generalizable model. So it was like, they'll you have to know that is has models have stayed. That's a of the other models she's.\nAbsolutely. I mean, frankly, I started using I would say, know, It's ovalical from out two years back when we play around get something to work but nothing use.\nSo we are still having been building our product, actually, in case you are wondering, so basically if I have not been working throughout on my family for the past three years in the center, was from half of the time after my wife passed two years back, so I took a break for nearly here.\nSo that's a sort of a nice situation, right? So yeah, so we are just like four people coming, we are still building our\nit can solve real-world use cases rather than you see the idea of, let's not, so yeah so we are in that situation right now.\n\n@8:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, this is good, this is a venue, so I mean I'll just give you a background on this also, I mean with you.\n\n@8:22 - Amitoj Cheema\nOne more thing, so I've been concerned other companies along the way, in many domains, using January, which is what we call, know, a travel domain or even resource management.\nPeople actually, you call it human resources. So we can talk about those as well, but yeah, my primary. So consulting business along with this.\n\n@8:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, and consulting a government of politics, a single person, I mean, show or you have other.\n\n@8:59 - Amitoj Cheema\nYeah, yeah, I Because not guys are like you know, yeah expert or whatever you want for it for different companies And any number you want to peg, you can even say no, I don't want to peg a number, but I number you want to peg in the revenue with this.\nYeah, which I mean, because I think we have and send it is you guys not a good point.\n\n@9:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, jumping straight into this now, what do you think has been your biggest when using a gen AI so far, right?\nIt's a tangible benefit in terms of the window in terms of time saved in terms of basically boiling down to money in the end somewhere.\n\n@9:55 - Amitoj Cheema\nSee, is it for now is that I mean, I can only talk in terms of Medicaid, so it's not clear here.\nI'd be alarmed by spending energies. At least in my setup, I don't see that. Maybe because I'm a little biased, only terms of care, Mac, know, why should use a nuclear bomb when a smaller AI model can do the same thing, right?\nMaybe at bias comes in somewhere. If already models say, I'm good at AI, I like to use smaller things, apply GPU, launch circuit, bad guys, then using open AI.\nSo, I don't have seen a really great, mean, he's\n\n@11:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nFor the consultation, are doing a major and jump. have a major change in the revenue.\n\n@11:05 - Amitoj Cheema\nSo, see, you have to the trust of whatever I've done is to understand the latent desires of our consumers.\ncan sometimes see, obviously, I will talk about the travel domain, right? Earlier, they used to be like, I said, I'll filter to hang up papers booking.com page.\nYou know, you can say, search for two people behind that and, you know, can we find the little way of photo?\ntook them. So, cool to have me do it when I say yes. Can we find the latent desires of the person?\nYeah, when you say, K.R., man, you know, I'm going out with the friends. This is a good professional way of going out.\nPlease suggest an itinerary or, you know, good hotel for me. Can I, send a friend, say, I see a joke, hey, can I just basically try to, can I make some sort of, you know, can he infer that he wants to hang up?\nat night, he wants some discourse kind of a place, then he's going with a family, can we in process things, which I have not explicitly mentioned.\nSo, property is according to that. So, Vohappe, it does actually work. I mean, we are able to, it's again costly, costs time, mean, you don't get, it takes sometimes 20 seconds, 30 seconds to reply to you with those things, but it does work, essentially.\nbut you explicit the diagnosis in context, Vohappe, you can use it.\n\n@12:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, I would say is that, mean, can structure the data by the Vohappe.\n\n@12:43 - Amitoj Cheema\nI mean, you can type it out, but the thing is, if you're looking, I mean, let's say, I talk about your use case, when you have a total in Vohappe.\nNow, you obviously know, my child looks at me, I mean, those are whatever, right? know, three people, one room, two rooms, this is my budget, you already know that before you start looking right, but there are, but when you look at 10 results on booking.com, you tend to have a photo shoot, which as well as looking, I could not put it in words, right?\nSo who is latent in your opinion, desires now, who, who, which will be conversation calls? Yeah, even that, is he going for a honeymoon?\nWhat should I be talking number of people? The honeymoon is going to go right. No, I should I even go into that direction, right?\nWe can sort of improve the user interaction.\n\n@13:42 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, understood. So latent desire user interaction is one, where you see here, this can be beneficial, but we don't have a tangible money, I it can have an initial effect, right?\n\n@13:54 - Amitoj Cheema\nOkay, so I'll tell you what, so this company started off with, you know, this vision, built an agent. Now, if you ask the same questions in a low car budget, what is the benefit to the end-user?\nThat's right. So, let's go find the new one, right? So can you do better than that, can you, that was sort of, that was the thing, So, yeah, so low effort work, maybe we would, you know, that is the thing that maybe, this is 10x better than the current solution, so that is, it's going to be, we don't have the numbers.\nAnd some people are happy, some people are not, but see, that was also pretty heavy news, so it's hard to say that it's not a benefit to us.\n\n@14:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, this is, this is exactly the problem for which couples can simpler hide me, right? Okay. The problem is that...\nPeople make AI's but evaluation which is the most critical piece of things is yet not in a place where you can say hey is this AI 10% more effective 30% white percent yeah 80% where how effective it is.\n\n@15:18 - Amitoj Cheema\nMaybe I'm not the right person because we were not running a business. I'm not a 50% company or 100% company where you know I'm yeah I can't benefit right because all good is better 10x better we have more so much it's he came up with number okay everybody's adding some AI features concept like that I think just will set long amount to here's a video so if you don't have drop the project for it goes nowhere no we have we have some so if you if you don't I can I can help you out with that later on we have a lot of projects so that is a different way to go up next we have to go yeah let me know what your company is about here it's like you know I don't think I this\nI can't give you a number, it's not a benefit to one. Okay.\n\n@16:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, yeah, that makes kind of sense. I see, it'll make a drastic difference. let us say, I understand the fact that you don't have a number on how much of a difference it has made, but in the best of your professional knowledge, you can have a different asset.\nThis is the kind of thing that I'm looking at.\n\n@16:27 - Amitoj Cheema\nIf potential is huge, to potential that, I use it for brainstorming. use it brainstorming. for brainstorming. I use it for brainstorming.\nyou can write it for me, can write me, I do not. my notebook, I'm sometimes even jagivative. When I'm playing a company, Jobe, a project, a Jobe, a C-cell, Jobe, a Piawai, a T2, Then I ask for it.\nHow valuable will be a certain feature, certain thing, you know what? You actually should be there or something like that and it answers me perfectly Yeah, I said she gets it has the contest here come character like over vp of time It is doing wonderful.\nYou're that so maybe if you want a number, okay? would not hire people because I have chargey bidy Even for marketing I could Marketing emails to have Or your mother is you really content and that's all I did you know Vobi's height my future will say well that year, right?\nBut then what's good?\n\n@17:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI think it's good. mean I was to a day and could you go like that?\n\n@17:34 - Amitoj Cheema\nYeah, like compends it on can I see it's like see I know how he designs and everything but the content you have yeah Yeah, whatever, right?\nWhat oh I'm 30 to say other okay, so it's like I'm a man who's like a club where Germany's I am Because I can't I am moving over there but he can zoom a little bit.\nYes for guys of mine, right? Yeah But they are self-serving, the loop has you.\n\n@18:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nany benefit is done, exactly.\n\n@18:05 - Amitoj Cheema\nSee, definitely if you ask, if I wrote some, the content verses, the activity is much more refined content, so it's good out-heaning.\n\n@18:17 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, content is better, the quality of content in terms of brainstorming, in terms of generative content is better, right?\nand textures.\n\n@18:26 - Amitoj Cheema\nIf it does, the, basically logical reasoning with you as well. So, maybe it does very well. If I ask you, I mean, I can tell you, okay, so this is something which we are doing at ATTec, I mean, my friend, me as well, that previously we could not solve for through it kind of questions, you know, it tends great to have these triangles, like, you know, whatever, can you find out, is it similar or not, or is it similar to that angle?\nIf you ask it, if you ask that guy, he does it. So, Jhape, he is reasoning how to do mass problems here.\nOkay, right. It does a solid way. So, we are trying to integrate that into our control. But the pathogen rule basically, I mean, that is, it's amazingly good.\nOkay.\n\n@19:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. So, basically, images, texts, generation and some logical reasoning in which it's doing good. So, said, I don't need a PM, it does the, there are huge problems with hallucination where it will be very, very confidently and with lot of data with one small mistake, give you such answers that, I mean, it will be very difficult to determine, give a Sahihaki Galta.\nYeah. Yeah.\n\n@19:56 - Amitoj Cheema\nIf you ask it a very specific question and see, they are very, to run around that. Here, provide your reasoning as well.\nYou can. Now, if I had to answer little, and like, you know, two years, I'd say, hey, how is the answer?\nAnd you just give some hallucinated answer. Now, you say, and give me step-by-step reason. So, why not if you ask it that, it doesn't matter.\nI mean, the other tricks and, know, you see context, know, but how much I know, it's up to the mouth, up to the right, It's email, so I can give it the algorithm.\nLike, let's say, when we do, yeah, when you say with your properties, I hear in Goa versus when I want in New York, you know, property in New York.\nSo, it's me, either in value side, right? It was me. I want a medium or cheap property. It's definition change, right?\nSo, this guy can, if you ask the kid, you go through the hotel bookings, divide them into three parts, choose the lowest one, or sort them and choose the, you worst one.\nI'm it can do very well even now as well. That's right. That's whole reason.\n\n@21:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou can keep it targeted because the more reason you go wider, it will start doing crap.\n\n@21:18 - Amitoj Cheema\nIf you give it an open-ended question to be prepared to have a car like that, but if I give it the algorithm as a human rule, then I can use it to be a seeker.\nSo it will give you very, very good search. Great.\n\n@21:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat. So that's basically two things where I got that there is benefit. One in terms of doing latent desire, finding and things which are not very like straight away obvious, you have to actually dig in and figure out the NLP side of things and take out answers.\nright. That's right. didn't get you. I said one part that you said was. figure out the latent desires, the non obvious questions and the non obvious data, basically.\n\n@22:06 - Amitoj Cheema\nYes.\n\n@22:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThe second one that you said was basically in terms of image text generation, that is utilized in multiple different places, right?\nThe third one was brainstorming.\n\n@22:17 - Amitoj Cheema\nSorry. Ah yeah, that brainstorming is useful, whatever you want to call it.\n\n@22:22 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbrainstorming and reasoning or third thing. So these are things which is where you think it's doing good. Where did you see it?\n\n@22:29 - Amitoj Cheema\nSo you really feel it. you ask it to do a very specific job, like you are a Muslim. Okay.\nSorry. So, like obviously once you have this code generation. So, it can't do that. It can give you a very simple 5.9 code to run.\nif you want a production ready. which completely fails. Even at the levels of Jhape, where I say KR, know, GA, hotel, Kachahakele here, right, even though I have given these specific instructions, it will become a busy accuracy to the point percent denying the level of data.\nBut I mean, in that, I can take 5 percent as a failure rate. So, I don't mind that. But with the code, I can't do that.\nThat's right. I mean, there's no scope of error over there, right? Yeah. doesn't Or my kahabula. And the biggest complaint is where it is not useful at all.\nIs that it's a lot of pain. I got my 95 percent acquisition which are here.\n\n@23:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd I'm doing an online system.\n\n@24:00 - Amitoj Cheema\nlike a travel agent or whatever. Nobody is going to call it a response which comes after one minute. That's right.\nSo, we just want to emphasize everything I have over 360 copies here, I can use it. But yeah, that's not the time logo.\nThis is not a useful product.\n\n@24:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, you should try diffusion in them. But accuracy could be, if I can, I will try all the models, but the acronym has come up which basically, now remember to stable diffusion, your image will occur.\nYeah, yeah, just stable diffusion that is basically is, you would say, blindingly fast, right, and it is working at the level already right now.\nOkay, that's already there. Oh, we tried Grok and we tried the other, I don't see it.\n\n@24:53 - Amitoj Cheema\nAgain, we did it. So, what we found is the And on this scale, we ask it to a very specific, very small question.\nOkay. Then take that result, run it through your code. That way code, this is not solvable, it's not an NP, you know, you run NP, hard problem, it feels like a little bit closer to your code, then go back to your code.\n\n@25:18 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, with the problems, again, you need specialized people who can actually catch the , right? Otherwise, you, you, benefit is very limited on this one, right?\nIs this an asset, you know, see, it's just a VM anymore, right?\n\n@25:32 - Amitoj Cheema\nLet me talk about charge GPT, right? The charge GPT must reach the patient part of the channel, patient, I mean, if I want to infer what is your hidden desire, give me 20 things and generate them on 20 different dimensions, give what sort of property you're looking for.\nNow, I don't ask you to search, I mean, you do the search itself, then I run it to my own search engine, KVR, certainly, although based on these hidden desire, these things with input, then.\nand you go back a sharp path to linear how do you assort them then you again go back to the KF subset barrier console because these things you can do in quicker time again just could put up the property in area and then ask KF search to his herself no to talk to I got right so it's like for coming up in line line graph you are gonna be taking your you know line chain logic production we need to take it like there's a node you run some of your rule based code so that's you know well that is I think where we are heading that only uncertain parts will go out of your python code but people can very you should try to wait within that code right right so basically I mean if I summarize what you are saying is this is non deterministic model right which means right yeah which means you can be same\n\n@27:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwhich means it has a randomization in between it.\n\n@27:03 - Amitoj Cheema\n5% this percent failure rate is so high year.\n\n@27:06 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo that is the biggest problem that you see right now.\n\n@27:10 - Amitoj Cheema\nSo, you know you can't run the production grade system, critical system on 10, 8% failure rate, especially even combined with other 10% to 10% because they have those criteria.\nis a 40% of the year. Multiply with that. Multiply with the The second is obviously time. The other half of the year you take when you run the secondary and you end up calling 3.4 APIs.\nSo, you will the name of 5 years only so later. It is useful to me.\n\n@27:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI agree. Time and accuracy as a main culprit that you see as a usability code can make it clear.\nYep. what else do you feel is probably in a third deterrent in terms of care.\n\n@28:08 - Amitoj Cheema\nSo, I don't see that as a challenge, and even the privacy concerns are there, can run your own elements, even now, on your own GPUs.\nNo concerns, people don't mind that anyway. So, the only thing that I'm doing, these are the two things. Often, down these days, if you want to run it, know, we have ample time to run some analysis, or get it away from the chat.\n\n@28:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, and what do you feel about its ability to actually, mean, we have touted it a lot, but when having an actual conversation with an actual student, or having an actual conversation with an actual, that's your own agent, right?\nSure. you think it's there right now? I'm asking this pointy question because I have handled this problem, and I would like to move your opinion in terms of the\n\n@29:00 - Amitoj Cheema\neducation platform see may I go completely hand off me almost like I said that the work the way we have I've been working with it for past few years like there's my code which I control completely I think code right and at certain points I call the non deterministic because I say phone is there okay are you do the speech attacks and then run the you know pass it to the alarm now over there I if I and after every time I give it a very specific contract give I was very well but if you ask you do you go you know whatever open ended it's your own trivial to one half of Jaga but but if you every time you're like yeah do not go beyond my scope stick to what I have asked you to do to it first well it's not a okay okay got it now I'll I'll go to what you mentioned at the beginning right get over here\n\n@30:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nproduct it or best could use career business must go directly use. But there are other ways in which businesses are using it today.\nexample, in HR, answering people's query, many people had to actually get to there where answer those queries that can be easily answered using a rag data easily or even L1 support.\nL1 support is almost gone, right? Most of the companies have just turned into L1 support because L1 support has nothing, no knowledge needed.\nIt's just a knowledge that we can simulate. Then there are things like these which like let's say the first level email answering, right?\nOr regular reminders, right? In terms of putting regular reminders in human form where you want to be more sensitive in terms of the language that you are using, right?\nNow, have you been using it or are you planning to use it in those different segments? example, For example, HR,\nAnd again, I understand that the organization is small right now, right? But you're consulting with other organizations also, and you are also probably in very soon, hopefully you're going to build this up to a size that doesn't give you any time.\nSo, there you are.\n\n@31:17 - Amitoj Cheema\nSee, they go mad. It's also the half-sliding head, right? Wherever you say, okay, I don't need to write, file the email immediately, right?\nHlkv. They are not like right now, and you're just in the next five seconds. So, after it is, it will work beautifully.\nNo doubt. It's in the online systems, jumping, mission critical problems, jumping up. We used to think that's up to you.\nHlkv. I use it for PM purpose, you know, whatever, right? works very well. So, thank you. That's perfect. mean, does a job.\n\n@31:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. And. Okay.\n\n@32:00 - Amitoj Cheema\nplus companies are putting up push push in terms boss you have to use AI because if you don't use it right i am not going to keep you right there are other push from some companies some companies right children come say i do not want you to use genai i see the companies and the reason they say so some of the developers are becoming so dependent on genai that they have stopped using their own brains right okay i don't think that is a concern for the companies so one of the companies are consulting with they do this customer support business for that they have to use me i mean use my email based customer support so he has a he has a here genai is because i have to use email so i think i have to use so i think i is now genai is a role of the team boss genai is the engineer\nJiniya can capture the gas up there, right? Well, he's also concerned. Well, in Jiniya's, have no applications. have no they no applications.\nhave have no applications. But that is so far away from the needs of the customer. Absolute, right? PM Kapagani, Jiniya capabilities have no In Jiniya's opinion, Jiniya have Whatever projects you start off with.\nIn this value, it goes to us. This end up, that project goes to us. So, you need somebody who says...\nYou are getting wanted.\n\n@33:35 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd I see this in a different way. I mean, I've had a lot of interviews so far. And I use these words exactly as a...\nexactly as use these exactly as ...I use these words exactly makes sense to the customer.\n\n@33:53 - Amitoj Cheema\nAbsolute.\n\n@33:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolute.\n\n@33:55 - Amitoj Cheema\nOh!\n\n@33:56 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMaybe if I... What do you learn to get out of it?\n\n@34:00 - Amitoj Cheema\nWhat customer needs, you know, what's for now both the ingenious open other equals now, which I mean really it's a we are customer You are right, but no, that's not the what your business needs right business value is worth missing here Yep, those may maybe if the PMs know what are the capabilities are the up to date of the genia is capabilities From where they are you know educated across the board Then you will see it's more very started rolling in because the most non-imagine the Which is not very prominent from what I hear because people are there.\n\n@34:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThey are very shallow. They're not deep in in that is that is that right?\n\n@34:34 - Amitoj Cheema\nSee Jeff the company could use make here and I'm not saying as a charity video. Are you have actually use you know some With the code you have something much opportunity.\nYeah, you're not pretty like a cat capabilities. I can't ask you to get it Absolutely I mean at this point just using chat if it's you okay, we can't take a yes a curve like that.\nNo, it might but not a guarantee right so in terms of I mean and I'm just trying to narrow down bit to the education side of things now what do you think that if everything goes hunky-dory like okay it's not great what is the biggest benefit it can give it give to you in in this product and man so the our aim is to be a virtual teacher okay I believe we are at this point we are this using element you know combination of our own system we can build a virtual teacher we can go down to the level so we are doing this already right if you are adding two fractions right let's start with smaller you know it's more phenomenon and what's also it's any other okay it's something you can't because it's going below that right\nthe common factors. now we can do that, we can deep dive into one problem to the level of the kid.\nJust like a human teacher would, right? hello, can you give me that? will help you out at a certain level, right?\nSo I think that's very, very strong possibility that over the next four months we are at two, that's level we are we actually become one.\n\n@36:31 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut two years back, what you are talking about right now is something that we built two years back. And you must have gone through with Khan Academy, must have gone through, I don't know, Alpha and GD are not.\n\n@36:43 - Amitoj Cheema\nWe have, we have, we have different level all together. I mean, if I. give you a demo sometime. It's not even close to where like you write on your tablet hand written answers.\nAnd we will analyze what you are thinking processes. Are you moving in the right direction, following a problem? If you've made a mistake, go ahead and take the concept.\nIf you want to deep dive into that concept, it's like all of that we can do that even now.\nSo, I think why will teacher assistant put out a new name, but why will teacher assistant is definitely possible.\n\n@37:33 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, that's one of the places. if I boil that down into a nutshell, what I would say is, it is able to help you immediately when required, because the student doesn't have any answer, that is the problem.\n\n@37:52 - Amitoj Cheema\nSee, that is essentially the problem. You get a feedback on it from one week later. It's no use. The students are solid for working in Kiska, Kiawaka.\nAbsolutely. So yeah, right there, right then immediately up to hand holding will that is something that I mean, yeah, as an assistant each like I said, it's the same possibility.\nThat's great.\n\n@38:19 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nmean, I've seen this happening and it is something that really benefits students. So I'm pretty sure you guys are going to put this out.\nIf I can be of any help, you won't stay disturbing any help that I can be of. Kabibi, know my can ping and we can get together.\n\n@38:35 - Amitoj Cheema\nI would love to have your views, know, I'd like to give you demo sometime. Sure. maybe, you know, just scale without a button here experience what more we can add into this.\nAnytime.\n\n@38:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnytime. Yeah. Let's schedule some time. Let's sit and have a look at it. And again, I mean. those are something that we actually have been working with students who are actually using it, right?\nhave their own kids, right, so there would be a lot of inputs that I can probably share out. it will be over time, let me know, it will be to sit together and go through it.\n\n@39:25 - Amitoj Cheema\nJust to let you know, we have been running a pilot in a school for the past one year.\n\n@39:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nA hundred.\n\n@39:33 - Amitoj Cheema\nOne job, yeah. One job, But it's also an accident actually. I can't say, the kids love it and the teachers are like, are you able to say that.\nSo, we are doing things, but we are adding seven to nine tenths, because one day but these are the kids.\n\n@39:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthat's awesome that's awesome but yeah so I think I have all my answers Thank you so much, he requested and introduced me to two more people who can actually get together, less like this conversation, more than this.\n\n@40:14 - Amitoj Cheema\nYes, sir, I will talk to him, so two companies travel, you know, the customer support I can talk to them.\nAbsolutely.\n\n@40:26 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwill really help me out.\n\n@40:29 - Amitoj Cheema\nThank you, sir. Thank you, for your time.\n\n@40:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you.\n\n@40:32 - Amitoj Cheema\nAll right, take care.\n\n@40:34 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAll right, right, but how much in case you think that I can be of any help at any point of time, please feel free to ping me and I'll meet you with you.\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n@40:48 - Amitoj Cheema\nThank you.\n\n@40:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nTake care, sir.\n\n@40:50 - Amitoj Cheema\nBye bye.

Thank you so much, man, for taking this up. Sure, sure, sure. So, how you you I'm the UK.\nI'm UK, I'm UK. UK. I'm I'm UK. And I'm a bunch of things we would love to read when I finalize this.\nBut there are... I mean, you'll be surprised that there are a lot of companies who are doing great, but they do not want to be fully fledged into this or write the bandwagon just here.\nWhat's it here? What's it here? Right? Okay. So, I think even if you are not directly using it, there's no way you can avoid key developers.\nhave multiple provided users. Maybe everyone is using it. Absolutely. So, that is basically a discussion. Okay. I'm not ready to move.\nLet me get... or may extensively be used to repeat this upload discovery. Right? that's a discussion, right? So I have no respect.\nSure. Great. So I have a set of questions and divided into 300 before that. We keep this was around 27 years in technology.\nI have been working across very different companies, mostly in the last few years in CDM Alumet. So that's a very short background.\nA research career, PhD, social health company, I did the least, but pre-BSD, so let's figure out one problem and see how that works out before I run for a PhD.\nSo you can fix the BSD. Sure. team section in the toward the escrow, let's just put the cohort in the right place, key harm data to the driver.\nSecond part, key tangible benefits. We get on the ground and think about the bone limit. Like chan-jibili chan-belry-jaz. chan-bili-belry-jaz.\nAnd the third part will be more of opinion scheme. What do you think? And the question will revolve around that.\nSure, sure. So to begin with, what industry and sector would you segment yourself in?\n\n@2:21 - Subodh Kumar\nAI research. This is a speech if I'm not wrong.\n\n@2:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI was told that I was the company that was the last company okay so are we which is the company this is a new startup no worries so during this interview maybe you can say I don't want to share this or you can say give me share took around looking a don't\nPut it in the paper, this is all our understanding here, best shared around, okay? Sure, sure. Cool both ways.\nSo, AI research may have been any specific sector that we are focusing on, or is it like a more generic AI research?\n\n@3:13 - Subodh Kumar\nYou can say your fundamental research types.\n\n@3:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nCool, and if we talk about a company size, the revenue fill out, is it pretty? No, no revenue, at least it is.\n\n@3:27 - Subodh Kumar\nIt was three revenue, basically.\n\n@3:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, and size if you can disclose it in five people. Less than 10 people. Cool, that's just for segmentation, no other rationale.\nagain, if you want to not disclose proper, okay, if you want to share with me and you say, okay, don't quote again, that's fine, okay?\nNow, in terms of NGO research that range of Balare, RV using, so let me first set the So, AI is a larger cohort, right?\nInside AI would be something like ML.\n\n@4:07 - Subodh Kumar\nInside ML something would be like deep learning, right?\n\n@4:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd JNI is a smaller cohort inside that, right? So, it's like very niche side of things. And our focus today in the discussion would be mostly JNI AI.\nOkay. Okay. Now, uh, this context, uh, most of all, I don't agree to this hierarchy.\n\n@4:29 - Subodh Kumar\nWhy is that? Yeah. Any new AI technology comes, right? common use of AI is something new.\n\n@4:55 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you.\n\n@5:00 - Subodh Kumar\nAIO here, because speech, we were saying speech was an AI, Casa Casa Casa. But I was going to use one in like that common place one Jata to describe namba in Jata.\n\n@5:11 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAbsolutely, absolutely. Right, so Abhi, Jenny, I can keep an adoption. I'm the current work you are doing.\n\n@5:20 - Subodh Kumar\nWe have quite good adoption, I would say.\n\n@5:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd when you said adoption, how do you put that?\n\n@5:30 - Subodh Kumar\nEspecially this 2025, say, and the quality has improved enough for its users in coding, and learning.\n\n@5:47 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBecause if you are doing research, or if you are working on new things, you have to do a lot of learning, human learning.\nAbsolutely, absolutely. So coding and human learning are too... dimensions where you would be adopting basically right now yeah great now just to just to go down a bit into it now coding when we say we have like a plethora of tools out there right some of them gold some of them add some of them choice wise it totally depends now is it that we are actually tangibly investing and getting returns in terms of saving time saving effort saving let us say better quality what what is a tangible outcome you see when you say may let me use around coding glitz what is the tangible benefit saving time saving effort saving time and saving effort okay and the quality is it similar is it better is it worse and friends upon who are you comparing with right it's like if you're comparing with a\n\n@7:00 - Subodh Kumar\nsmart engineer who's already experienced in that field and then the quality is not better.\n\n@7:09 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut if somebody is inexperienced, if you are new to this field, definitely the quality is better.\n\n@7:21 - Subodh Kumar\nI understand.\n\n@7:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbasically Agarmay expensive resource background to already better quality meals at the year. But then that that's expense also right.\nSo, cost benefit issues to match it. Yeah. And in this case using key pressure to also can get access to better, bigger knowledge and they can save time and effort.\n\n@7:40 - Subodh Kumar\nBasically human productivity, if you are it is aiding everyone, even a senior engineer will get benefit. I'm just doing with comparison.\nYou cannot substitute a senior engineer to that. Yeah.\n\n@7:54 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nthe way I'm putting it is this is we will be specific on what we are doing. and then generic, right?\nSo specifically, you can look at the company may use career, which may be saving us time and effort. And we are saying that when it is a junior developer, saves more time and effort.\nProbably for a senior developer, it will save less time and effort, but it still seems, right?\n\n@8:17 - Subodh Kumar\nThat's still contribute. It will still contribute.\n\n@8:20 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nGreat. I'm not talking about career. Sorry, you were saying something.\n\n@8:24 - Subodh Kumar\nYeah, thank you. Even a senior developer can take its help in debugging.\n\n@8:30 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. Great.\n\n@8:32 - Subodh Kumar\nOr any particular area they are not familiar with? Great.\n\n@8:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, Jadhamruh, I mean, one side is coding. other is code review. I mean, you are having that entire cycle of correction and other things.\nI'm hearing very good about from different people. like code generator. But are we also using it in maintenance and reviews and auto?\nit's like anything else.\n\n@9:02 - Subodh Kumar\nWe are early-stage to which type of code menu.\n\n@9:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. So it's more about generation right now. Generation and debugging.\n\n@9:11 - Subodh Kumar\nOkay.\n\n@9:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nreview will get again here.\n\n@9:14 - Subodh Kumar\nAre you looking to be Review will be career. just thinking. I'm a very early-stage company. Different tasks are of different importance to generation and debugging is more important.\nOkay.\n\n@9:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd how do you? How do you tangibly try and calculate the make-o-kituna benefit? I mean, is it a 2x?\nIs it 10x? Is it 100x benefit?\n\n@9:37 - Subodh Kumar\nNo, we don't have a metric right now. Okay.\n\n@9:41 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnd to the best of your, what you can see, I mean, of the back of an envelope calculation, how do you calculate the idea?\nIt's saving me. You said it's saving me effort. The current cost is very low.\n\n@10:00 - Subodh Kumar\n$30 per person, let's say, or agar dothin hapna lei lei a to pachas dor per person, right? So I can surely say to usa tajada bhannifata, significantly multiple times, usa tajada bhannifatoga, cost benefit analysis may not be associated with me.\n\n@10:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, so basically based on the time and effort, would you please develop a tutorial, should you apply video rather more than please develop a same career.\nGreat. Now, if I go to the second part of things, then I will come back to this one, but learning may, there is a lot that can be done with it, right?\nSo are we again able to put some amount of cost benefit analysis to it here, kithya na benefit makum will learn in terms of again time, say, fast effort.\n\n@10:44 - Subodh Kumar\nI think agar, if you looking for numbers specifically, then maybe somebody was using it a large size and they can tell you.\nEven on your size.\n\n@10:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI can just tell you key, I can just tell you key top level pay, it's beneficial.\n\n@11:00 - Subodh Kumar\nUhh man, numbers exactly, you are learning about the Kutzae, between the two of probably most of I think time to be tried, basically time to be is one of the main things.\n\n@11:13 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nquality memory of Kutzae, Kutzae, Kutzae, and Hunkae, Kutzae, all the numbers are just blindly trusting the numbers that he is showing us.\nthen he has to use No, you not blindly trust it.\n\n@11:23 - Subodh Kumar\nYou cannot blindly trust it. You have to question what are the other things. So, it's a continuous continuous way to make ex-alpha little body backwasta.\n\n@11:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo, we are using it for research, right? When we say we are saving time, saving time. It's an eight example which I use is a Google notebook, right?\n\n@11:50 - Subodh Kumar\nNew paper. So, we have new So, have to make a new paper. I know how to put paper on the paper I don't to put paper on so summarization and basically Criticism is not good Why do you think this paper is not good?\n\n@12:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBecause most of the papers are not good So you have to quickly form your view of criticism Ca problem is fine Right Why is this good?\nI think it's a great job at it A decent job, I wouldn't say a great job, but decent enough, yeah So ultimately, one of the major time savings is summarization, right?\n\n@12:36 - Subodh Kumar\nYeah, you can say summarization and And sometimes pure learning, like, let's say you're field-a What's the problem, need to answer the answer?\nexample, let's say I'm researching human curiosity Right Because you have to think about humans when you think about creating new machines, right?\nIf humans make curiosity, is it that drives you? curiosity in human mind? or what they like to discovery of, let's say, electrons and protons, kimkea discovered once now, because similarly you have to program the machines to make discoveries.\nSo, on the most of course, have passed a historical fact, sorry, I had to say was a summary of what it was a validation of what It was a summary was.\nIt was a summary of what it I never tried it. It's like Wikipedia, that I had to be getting some of this and be in this.\nThis is which was not the start, I'm to Okay.\nACTION ITEM: Expand Gen AI testing for brainstorming/research; assess insight quality, new knowledge generation - WATCH\n\n@13:40 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay. So, here is an abstraction. It was basically a bollamy. It's an abstraction. Perhaps, this is an abstraction, was, CSS, it's Okay.\nAnd in summarization, extraction, is it also like brainstorming kiddia? I see human curiosity is like this. do you think?\nIt gives me some response. try and then logically I try to extract things out of it. You know, yes any word.\nabout this? If I do it this way, right? And so on.\n\n@14:17 - Subodh Kumar\nThat's, have started testing it out, but it's the early stage. And the current technology is quite early stage for these kind of things.\nBut I'm sorry I'm going to test my camera test here. And I think going forward, we will test it more in this direction.\n\n@14:32 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI mean, just too seriously, I mean, what has been the outcome of your initial test?\n\n@14:41 - Subodh Kumar\nI wouldn't say particularly good or It is, I'm quite impressed. I would say, it's totally useless.\n\n@14:50 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI'll be early stage. I'm sorry, was good and what was bad? What did it did well? What did it not do?\nBasically, well.\n\n@15:00 - Subodh Kumar\nIt's not in size full enough. Okay, it's not in size full enough.\n\n@15:03 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nHuh? No, it's not really value in them.\n\n@15:07 - Subodh Kumar\nsorry. walk inside full, which was the name of Tara. was basic.\n\n@15:10 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYou ended up miscurro.\n\n@15:12 - Subodh Kumar\nYeah, which basic. It was information. had to get there now. So then it's telling the historical facts, which was this.\nBut it is not here to generate new knowledge for you.\n\n@15:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSo it's not basically if I would say it cannot use the influence if that's the right word, right?\n\n@15:31 - Subodh Kumar\nOkay, can translate both standard definition as karekma.\n\n@15:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nIt's right. It's it's a, it's a chart fact that you have to ask for karekma, it's not in the Bible.\nbut it's meaning in the name of It's not Karasak, Karasak, Karasak.\n\n@15:51 - Subodh Kumar\nKarasak, Karasak, Knowledge, discovery, creating new knowledge. You cannot use it for that. So brainstorming my up. Both are talking.\nBut we cannot use it as a partner, but we I think we have use as a partner. It be useful, but we have use But then, then, are speaking and again I am just being a devotee.\n\n@16:25 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwith the advocate, right? Conversely speaking, just feel like Abhinne in Bata, Japata Hoga, Thumb probably it'll again not be that beneficial, right?\n\n@16:34 - Subodh Kumar\nYeah.\n\n@16:36 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, great. So new learning, Kiliye, Japata Mijan, Data Extract and I can trust it, that's fine, okay? But if I want to go much more in detail is what I understand, then I'll have to trade carefully.\ncan do it, but I have to have to trade carefully, right?\n\n@16:51 - Subodh Kumar\nSo again, if I talk about this knowledge extraction, it will give you, but as an insightful thought partner,\n\n@17:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nstill ugly right but i'll be saying we have to test karunga or consciously split test karunga is fair anything that i can be helpful with i am here so when we can always ping me out i work extensively with these but when we talk about uh again uh extraction both are hallucination beach map how do you try and avoid that and save your time on that even with extraction i have like isolation hard code order buck bean on it both for example generation have some buck nuclei right um and there are issues with that yeah and then i give back there's one so let us say it saved me one hour but we are bugging the killing game of you in buckskom assault karunga right does that i'm saving match or does yeah yeah buck me celtan because once karunga karunga karunga karunga karunga right it correctly did five things correctly tops up six now we could trust karunga or critically use kudek\n\n@18:00 - Subodh Kumar\nof it. This is generated code code. So, or, I don't say exact numbers, but probably 10% for bug hota.\nI agree with you. And in that case, the cost is higher. But we blindly trust system, then yes, the copy of the cost for the customer.\nWe constantly test whatever it is generating. So, we will trust it and you miss it and then it will cost.\n\n@18:57 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nwith we could be in for a quite a lot of negative surprises. Right. So, we got bad currently, but we have tried to be able to children and have them learn across, but that has been very interesting.\nLearning is there. will talk about that. That's so interesting. Yeah, what's much? We will talk about it later. What will be bad was I can use it.\nI'm such a big half. But yeah, I mean, now coming a bit backtracking myself. the project on the business, how is it benefiting?\nNow, how are we using it in terms of creating processes? for example, I have, I see majorly three kinds of when they are in between also, but majorly three kinds of companies.\nOne that says to all its employees, don't you have to use it whether you want it or not? Because if you don't use it and stuff, right?\nThat's one. Second kind of companies say, I don't care whether you use it or not, as long as you are delivering results, I'm good.\nhere are the options. You should really look at it because if you are not, then you're suffering on your own.\nI mean, I'm not suffering because you're always giving me stuff, right? And the third company says, Buss, do not use it from Jitra-Koruse-Bhanateo, Ussidaba-Devil-Tain-Tum-Detho-Dibangina, by may you screw it.\nYou are not going to use LMs. So in three, they are very generic, in between also lot of them.\nWhere do you place yourself in the way you think? The second one.\n\n@20:18 - Subodh Kumar\nThe second one.\n\n@20:21 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight. And in that, so you empower your people and you say, hey, if you want to use, if you don't want to use, you don't use, I don't care, but how it has to be this way, right?\nI may not accept it. And how do you empower them?\n\n@20:38 - Subodh Kumar\nI have only people who are empowered, who feel self-selection.\n\n@20:44 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSelf Self-selection, are you? I mean, again, I understand it's very small right now and it's growing up. Have any insight into key, this is what you want to use or you have used in the past key infrastructure deployment.\nit is coming up. Yeah, is coming up big way. Right. So, any other operational things where you want to be or you will be using it or you have tried using it.\n\n@21:19 - Subodh Kumar\nI don't think I have that classification for you. That's why I said okay. I'm going to come later.\n\n@21:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nAnyway, that's absolutely fine. You will try to make over. That's very insightful, right? Data sharing. mean, upload bahasarana proprietary data generator because you are working in research.\nI've worked in research for about five years, right? There's a lot of proprietary data that you generate and you and LLMs are taking it and they might be using it for their training or other purposes.\nHow comfortable are you with that going on?\n\n@22:00 - Subodh Kumar\nthe team plan here, they say key, they do not use that data. Correct, they say so.\n\n@22:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut you know how much they say so and how much? Yeah.\n\n@22:08 - Subodh Kumar\nSo, or Dusraki Abhithakamaju use kernel, it's a key, basic coding and Osmai use kernel. coding Osmai, it's not going to open up the code, so code there.\n\n@22:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nJust a little bit more, basically. Sorry? Super proprietary Abhithak which may arise mostly generally, but neither. Yeah, yeah.\n\n@22:33 - Subodh Kumar\nsuper property with the quality of the have to say, if you have an internal hosting card, can use internal hosting card then will be more conscious of that.\n\n@23:00 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nSince we are almost there in time, you have to leave at 6 by 13. So quick questions, hindsight volatility, was the hardest hurdle you have faced so far in implementing J&A as well?\nACTION ITEM: Test new LLM models incl. diffusion models for research tasks; compare w/ autoregressive - WATCH\n\n@23:22 - Subodh Kumar\nSo, what's wrong, are we going to a bit about world task is pretty bad. So, and latency needs to be improved.\n\n@23:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI hope retensically you have tried the new LLM models which have come in terms of diffusion model diffusion LLM.\n\n@23:47 - Subodh Kumar\nHuh we are going to try that I haven't tried it but it is interesting but I will go to auto regressive.\nFor a lot of tasks than diffusion models.\n\n@24:05 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah, I agree, I agree. Because autoregressive members of causal reasoning are calmer.\n\n@24:10 - Subodh Kumar\nRefusion assumes key. You know, have a source layer for kafikuts. Absolutely. Or you have to causal diffusion models are good.\nwill be good for, let's say, lot of tasks. I would say maybe significant majority of human tasks in fusion models would be good enough.\n\n@24:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nBut at the same time, problem is, you have to drill down thinking, okay, main point is you have to down.\nhave to drill down.\n\n@24:37 - Subodh Kumar\nlet's see.\n\n@24:38 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nWe are still in the works. Let's see. What is the most notable success? have failed personally.\n\n@24:49 - Subodh Kumar\nI think front-end coding. Front-end coding, V0.\n\n@24:53 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah.\n\n@24:55 - Subodh Kumar\nFront-end coding is doing pretty good.\n\n@24:58 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nI would say.\n\n@25:00 - Subodh Kumar\nand a Aik, Aik level of reasoning, I cannot say exactly what level came up, a reasoning it is helping in reasoning also.\n\n@25:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThis is the first level of reasoning, right?\n\n@25:18 - Subodh Kumar\nFirst level will not put us a uni rega, but I can just say in some reasoning tasks it is beneficial.\n\n@25:28 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nOkay, but that definition is still not clear in the head.\n\n@25:31 - Subodh Kumar\nIt is too at least to write up, it is technology but just to get concrete answers on the, and it is to do it tough.\nYou have to follow us about communication and you can find out.\n\n@25:43 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMy job has to spell it out. I have been into genia for the last year, so I understand these things, makes sense.\nsubset butter revelation came up till now. what you have been able to see. What's the biggest use of AI?\n\n@26:03 - Subodh Kumar\nRevolution AIK potentially, all human tasks can be automated away.\n\n@26:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nbased task. Potentially or knowledge task, right?\n\n@26:15 - Subodh Kumar\nYeah, and it is both positive and also concerning.\n\n@26:23 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nPositive case concerning guessing.\n\n@26:25 - Subodh Kumar\nPositive in the sense that you will do some other higher value tasks. So you will get a human so you get a lot of time.\nCost of goods and services will go will be very cheap.\n\n@26:39 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nConcerning Eki, so already knowledge workers have encountered a displacement.\n\n@26:45 - Subodh Kumar\nWhat is the impact on society?\n\n@26:49 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, right, right. And if you, with your current knowledge, I'll be knowing knowledge that you'll be here. But except what is, you can take yourself.\nIt will do differently with Janaya.\n\n@27:03 - Subodh Kumar\nOf course, the research direction. Okay.\n\n@27:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nExactly.\n\n@27:07 - Subodh Kumar\nBecause then you would know which things work better.\n\n@27:12 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight.\n\n@27:13 - Subodh Kumar\nYou will make less errors in your... Doesn't research. You take four experiments, four out of four works. Absolutely. No, you will take that direction which is more likely to work.\n\n@27:24 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nMakes sense. And the last question is What is your recommendation for companies who are looking to achieve digital transformation through Janaya?\nmean, what would be your opinion or your recommendation to then give a year career?\n\n@27:39 - Subodh Kumar\nI think people already know that. It's nothing new that I'm adding. Just try and experiment. Definitely. I'm I'm sorry.\nsorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But every field in your company, everything in your company is going to be automated away.\n\n@28:07 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nRight, and you are making energy.\n\n@28:11 - Subodh Kumar\nOkay, I have to experiment with this button now. Okay.\n\n@28:15 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nback, it after a year. Got it. So, thank you so much. I think I hit your time. Thank you so much.\nThank you. are taking a insightful layer. Why are you quite insightful? It's lovely to share and understand your experience.\n\n@28:33 - Subodh Kumar\nAwesome. Let me know.\n\n@28:37 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nYeah. will surely share it with you. And even before that, in case I think when with my experience, if there's anything I can help you with, just free to ping me at any point of time.\nShare it. Sure. Okay.\n\n@28:50 - Subodh Kumar\nTake care. Bye bye.\n\n@28:51 - Vicky Biswas (vickybiswas@gmail.com)\nThank you. Thanks. Bye bye.

Will that work?\n0:00:19 – 0:00:22\n\nYes, it will work.\n0:00:22 – 0:00:24\n\nPerfect.\n0:00:24 – 0:00:26\n\nSo, beginning with the first one.\n0:00:26 – 0:00:28\n\nWhich industry will you represent?\n0:00:28 – 0:00:31\n\nIs it like media?\n0:00:31 – 0:00:33\n\nIs it like events?\n0:00:33 – 0:00:35\n\nNot events.\n0:00:35 – 0:00:36\n\nEntirely event management?\n0:00:36 – 0:00:38\n\nEntirely. Hardcore.\n0:00:38 – 0:00:40\n\nCorporate only.\n0:00:40 – 0:00:41\n\nThat too corporate.\n0:00:41 – 0:00:42\n\nSo basically, corporate event management, mostly if you can say it like that.\n0:00:42 – 0:00:45\n\nI am the official event manager for the Indian Army, Indian Navy, other countries and BJP.\n0:00:45 – 0:00:51\n\nWhether they come in corporate or not, we will see.\n0:00:51 – 0:00:53\n\nOkay. Basically, yes, we can say corporate.\n0:00:53 – 0:00:58\n\nBut for businesses or for government officials, you are basically an event management company, right?\n0:00:58 – 0:01:03\n\nYes, absolutely.\n0:01:03 – 0:01:05\n\nOkay.\n0:01:05 – 0:01:07\n\nAnd, I mean, at any point, if you feel that you can't share the information,\n0:01:07 – 0:01:12\n\nor you feel that I am sharing this information, but don't quote it, then it's fine.\n0:01:12 – 0:01:16\n\nI will say it first, then you can decide.\n0:01:16 – 0:01:19\n\nSo, the size of the company in terms of people and in terms of revenue, how much will it be roughly?\n0:01:19 – 0:01:24\n\nNow, I have two companies and three offices.\n0:01:24 – 0:01:29\n\nSo, are you asking for a collective or a particular company?\n0:01:29 – 0:01:31\n\nI am asking for a collective, there is no issue.\n0:01:31 – 0:01:33\n\nSir, will it be 150 or 150?\n0:01:33 – 0:01:36\n\nBenchmarks. 150?\n0:01:36 – 0:01:38\n\n150, 150, 151. By the way, I know exactly how much it is. 151.\n0:01:38 – 0:01:42\n\nOkay. 151. And, roughly how much will the revenue be in the tune of?\n0:01:42 – 0:01:46\n\nYou mean, the revenue will be in the tune of a turnover?\n0:01:46 – 0:01:49\n\nYes, roughly.\n0:01:49 – 0:01:51\n\nHave you met the three companies?\n0:01:51 – 0:01:54\n\nYes, roughly.\n0:01:54 – 0:01:56\n\nI didn't know that I had to do this.\n0:01:56 – 0:01:58\n\nOkay, okay.\n0:01:58 – 0:02:00\n\nThat's fine. We can…\n0:02:00 – 0:02:02\n\nSo, you are not going to do anything public about my company, right?\n0:02:02 – 0:02:06\n\nNo, no, no.\n0:02:06 – 0:02:08\n\nThis is basically for categorization, that which category should I put it in?\n0:02:08 – 0:02:12\n\nBecause I have companies ranging from pre-revenue to billion dollars.\n0:02:12 – 0:02:17\n\nSo, where should I fit it in between?\n0:02:17 – 0:02:20\n\nAnd, if you want, you can say…\n0:02:20 – 0:02:22\n\nI will say it.\n0:02:22 – 0:02:24\n\nBefore, we used to touch 70-80.\n0:02:24 – 0:02:28\n\nYes, yes.\n0:02:28 – 0:02:30\n\nNow, due to the pandemic, we have a quarter.\n0:02:30 – 0:02:32\n\nEveryone has been affected.\n0:02:32 – 0:02:34\n\nSo, what happened is that we reduced the office size.\n0:02:34 – 0:02:38\n\nWe have brought freelancers in between.\n0:02:38 – 0:02:41\n\nThere are a lot of them.\n0:02:41 – 0:02:43\n\nSo, our employees have given up their jobs and have settled down at home.\n0:02:43 – 0:02:47\n\nAnd now, they are freelancing for our fans.\n0:02:47 – 0:02:50\n\nSo, before, my friends used to get sick.\n0:02:50 – 0:02:52\n\nNow, everyone is sick.\n0:02:52 – 0:02:54\n\nThis is the condition of the whole industry.\n0:02:54 – 0:02:56\n\nYes, yes, yes.\n0:02:56 – 0:02:57\n\nSo, I don't even have 50.\n0:02:57 – 0:02:59\n\nIt's been 50-60 years.\n0:02:59 – 0:03:01\n\nRoughly.\n0:03:01 – 0:03:02\n\nTurnover.\n0:03:02 – 0:03:03\n\nTurnover.\n0:03:03 – 0:03:04\n\nIt's okay. It's okay, which is good.\n0:03:04 – 0:03:06\n\nAnd, if you are using AI in the company today,\n0:03:06 – 0:03:09\n\nAI is of many types, right?\n0:03:09 – 0:03:11\n\nSo, we are talking about generative AI.\n0:03:11 – 0:03:13\n\nSo, what are you using?\n0:03:13 – 0:03:15\n\nWhat are you using it for?\n0:03:15 – 0:03:17\n\nWe have used the $20 per month.\n0:03:17 – 0:03:19\n\nThe $20 per month.\n0:03:19 – 0:03:21\n\nYes.\n0:03:21 – 0:03:23\n\nWhich is considered bad in 11th grade.\n0:03:23 – 0:03:27\n\nWhich means that.\n0:03:27 – 0:03:29\n\nRight?\n0:03:29 – 0:03:30\n\nYes.\n0:03:30 – 0:03:31\n\nAnd I have kept two employees to do that.\n0:03:31 – 0:03:35\n\nBecause we have a lot of online business.\n0:03:35 – 0:03:39\n\nSo, there are a lot of time parcels.\n0:03:39 – 0:03:41\n\nBut, we can't refuse them.\n0:03:41 – 0:03:43\n\nAnd we can't work so hard on them.\n0:03:43 – 0:03:45\n\nSo, basically, what we do is,\n0:03:45 – 0:03:47\n\nwe get designs from the daalas.\n0:03:47 – 0:03:49\n\nAnd I have some softwares on my boys.\n0:03:49 – 0:03:51\n\nIn those daalas, they can do softwares,\n0:03:51 – 0:03:53\n\nor patch work,\n0:03:53 – 0:03:55\n\nor pick any of their logos,\n0:03:55 – 0:03:57\n\nor change the colors.\n0:03:57 – 0:03:59\n\nThen, we generate 50 and send it to them in one day.\n0:03:59 – 0:04:02\n\nThen, it gives a lot of production.\n0:04:02 – 0:04:04\n\nThis is what happens.\n0:04:04 – 0:04:06\n\nBy the way, OpenAI has made a brand new image,\n0:04:06 – 0:04:10\n\ntwo days ago.\n0:04:10 – 0:04:12\n\nEarlier, there was no text.\n0:04:12 – 0:04:14\n\nThe spelling was wrong.\n0:04:14 – 0:04:16\n\nNow, it's perfect.\n0:04:16 – 0:04:18\n\nNow, it's perfect.\n0:04:18 – 0:04:20\n\nIt was released yesterday.\n0:04:20 – 0:04:22\n\nAccording to the release yesterday,\n0:04:22 – 0:04:24\n\nit will be perfect.\n0:04:24 – 0:04:26\n\nIt will happen within 4GBT.\n0:04:26 – 0:04:28\n\nThis is new.\n0:04:28 – 0:04:30\n\nSir, this tea is here. This one is expensive.\n0:04:30 – 0:04:34\n\nI have been running it for a long time.\n0:04:34 – 0:04:36\n\nDon't do anything.\n0:04:36 – 0:04:38\n\nIf you have any problem, ask me.\n0:04:38 – 0:04:40\n\nI will pick up the phone.\n0:04:40 – 0:04:42\n\nI will definitely ask you.\n0:04:42 – 0:04:44\n\nApart from this,\n0:04:44 – 0:04:46\n\nthere are many video generation,\n0:04:46 – 0:04:48\n\nimage generation,\n0:04:48 – 0:04:50\n\nhow much do you do?\n0:04:50 – 0:04:52\n\nLike, video generation,\n0:04:52 – 0:04:54\n\ndo you do it or not?\n0:04:54 – 0:04:56\n\nI don't ask about video generation.\n0:04:56 – 0:04:58\n\nI will explain my business to you.\n0:04:58 – 0:05:00\n\nWe have got a trade,\n0:05:00 – 0:05:02\n\nfrom a client,\n0:05:02 – 0:05:04\n\na single guy,\n0:05:04 – 0:05:06\n\nto take a brief.\n0:05:06 – 0:05:08\n\nHe will take a brief,\n0:05:08 – 0:05:10\n\nhe will go to the creative,\n0:05:10 – 0:05:12\n\nhe will give a brief,\n0:05:12 – 0:05:14\n\nhe will give a bad date,\n0:05:14 – 0:05:16\n\nhe will negotiate with him,\n0:05:16 – 0:05:18\n\nhe will make a presentation,\n0:05:18 – 0:05:20\n\nhe will ask what is the seriousness,\n0:05:20 – 0:05:22\n\nwhat is its relevance,\n0:05:22 – 0:05:24\n\nwhat is its budget,\n0:05:24 – 0:05:26\n\naccording to that,\n0:05:26 – 0:05:28\n\nthe more expensive it is, the more we work,\n0:05:28 – 0:05:30\n\nand then we make a PPT and give it to production,\n0:05:30 – 0:05:32\n\nproduction gives its cost,\n0:05:32 – 0:05:34\n\nand then the same client goes back,\n0:05:34 – 0:05:36\n\nshows PPT,\n0:05:36 – 0:05:38\n\nshares cost with design elements,\n0:05:38 – 0:05:40\n\ngives a proposal, then comes the operation team,\n0:05:40 – 0:05:42\n\nyou can vet it.\n0:05:42 – 0:05:44\n\nThis is the procedure.\n0:05:44 – 0:05:46\n\nWe don't need video in this,\n0:05:46 – 0:05:48\n\nplus we have another company called Storyteller.\n0:05:48 – 0:05:50\n\nIn that, we make AVs for clients.\n0:05:50 – 0:05:52\n\nIn that, we don't use AI,\n0:05:52 – 0:05:54\n\nwe use it a lot.\n0:05:54 – 0:05:56\n\nWe haven't introduced AI yet.\n0:05:56 – 0:05:58\n\nOkay.\n0:05:58 – 0:06:00\n\nWhat does Storyteller do?\n0:06:00 – 0:06:02\n\nIn Storyteller, we make AVs,\n0:06:02 – 0:06:04\n\nwe have made a lot of AVs,\n0:06:04 – 0:06:06\n\nwe have made ads for our Airtel products,\n0:06:06 – 0:06:08\n\nso to give you a brief,\n0:06:08 – 0:06:10\n\nwe have, I mean,\n0:06:10 – 0:06:12\n\nCRI Events Private Limited\n0:06:12 – 0:06:14\n\nhas launched Airtel in India,\n0:06:14 – 0:06:16\n\nwe have launched Hatch in India,\n0:06:16 – 0:06:18\n\nwe have converted Hatch to Horus 2.\n0:06:18 – 0:06:20\n\nTill date, all the iPhones that have been launched,\n0:06:20 – 0:06:22\n\nand we\n0:06:22 – 0:06:24\n\nwere Telecom Giants at one time,\n0:06:24 – 0:06:26\n\nso when we were Telecom Giants,\n0:06:26 – 0:06:28\n\nthen we used to make\n0:06:28 – 0:06:30\n\nads for their Airtel,\n0:06:30 – 0:06:32\n\nthe ones that are shown on TV.\n0:06:32 – 0:06:34\n\nNow we don't make them, now we only make\n0:06:34 – 0:06:36\n\nthe AVs of Hard core products,\n0:06:36 – 0:06:38\n\nor their products have been AV-ed,\n0:06:38 – 0:06:40\n\nor their products have been AV-ed in the office.\n0:06:40 – 0:06:42\n\nOkay.\n0:06:42 – 0:06:44\n\nOkay.\n0:06:44 – 0:06:46\n\nIn that business,\n0:06:46 – 0:06:48\n\nin today's date,\n0:06:48 – 0:06:50\n\nAI is being used,\n0:06:50 – 0:06:52\n\nare you not using it now?\n0:06:52 – 0:06:54\n\nI will tell you, we don't use it,\n0:06:54 – 0:06:56\n\nwhat is the reason?\n0:06:56 – 0:06:58\n\nNow, our work is,\n0:06:58 – 0:07:00\n\nfor example, we have one dealer,\n0:07:00 – 0:07:02\n\none contact,\n0:07:02 – 0:07:04\n\nso Sony told us\n0:07:04 – 0:07:06\n\nthat we are going to our 200 dealers,\n0:07:06 – 0:07:08\n\nso make a hot AV,\n0:07:08 – 0:07:10\n\na hot connection,\n0:07:10 – 0:07:12\n\nwe use two stock AVs in it,\n0:07:12 – 0:07:14\n\nlike football, kick, kick, voice over,\n0:07:14 – 0:07:16\n\nthen there will be script writing,\n0:07:16 – 0:07:18\n\nthen you will be concerned,\n0:07:18 – 0:07:20\n\nthat we have this protection,\n0:07:20 – 0:07:22\n\nwe have to do this protection,\n0:07:22 – 0:07:24\n\nwe also do stock in it,\n0:07:24 – 0:07:26\n\nnow what is happening in stock,\n0:07:26 – 0:07:28\n\nwe also do shoots,\n0:07:28 – 0:07:30\n\ntheir officers will go to their seniors,\n0:07:30 – 0:07:32\n\ntheir factory will go and shoot from their factory,\n0:07:32 – 0:07:34\n\nand make a video,\n0:07:34 – 0:07:36\n\nso we don't need AI right now.\n0:07:36 – 0:07:38\n\nSo basically, you have to do production as well.\n0:07:38 – 0:07:40\n\nI have my own animators,\n0:07:40 – 0:07:42\n\nwho animate people,\n0:07:42 – 0:07:44\n\nso the animators who are sitting in the office,\n0:07:44 – 0:07:46\n\nfor example, I make AVs,\n0:07:46 – 0:07:48\n\nthose guys are different,\n0:07:48 – 0:07:50\n\nthey come to the office,\n0:07:50 – 0:07:52\n\nthey don't ask us anything,\n0:07:52 – 0:07:54\n\nbut they do their work,\n0:07:54 – 0:07:56\n\nso I don't argue with them,\n0:07:56 – 0:07:58\n\nthat my work is coming out,\n0:07:58 – 0:08:00\n\nnow my client servicing guys are saying,\n0:08:00 – 0:08:02\n\nsir do this in AV,\n0:08:02 – 0:08:04\n\nI said, bro, it's going, let it go,\n0:08:04 – 0:08:06\n\nif you listen to my rejection,\n0:08:06 – 0:08:08\n\nI said, the more organic we are,\n0:08:08 – 0:08:10\n\nwe use our human brain,\n0:08:10 – 0:08:12\n\nso I think, we use our brain,\n0:08:12 – 0:08:16\n\nwhat difference will it make,\n0:08:16 – 0:08:18\n\nthis is my attitude,\n0:08:18 – 0:08:20\n\nbut generally speaking, I think so.\n0:08:20 – 0:08:22\n\nOkay.\n0:08:22 – 0:08:24\n\nOkay.\n0:08:24 – 0:08:26\n\nI will go into a little more detail, okay?\n0:08:26 – 0:08:28\n\nYes, bro.\n0:08:28 – 0:08:30\n\nLet's say,\n0:08:30 – 0:08:32\n\nif we use AV,\n0:08:32 – 0:08:34\n\nif we make AV from AI,\n0:08:34 – 0:08:36\n\nand again,\n0:08:36 – 0:08:38\n\nyour attitude is very important to me,\n0:08:38 – 0:08:40\n\nbecause many people are positive,\n0:08:40 – 0:08:42\n\nand many are negative.\n0:08:42 – 0:08:44\n\nAnd both sides are important,\n0:08:44 – 0:08:46\n\nboth sides are important,\n0:08:46 – 0:08:48\n\nbecause there is a reason for being negative.\n0:08:48 – 0:08:50\n\nI am not negative,\n0:08:50 – 0:08:52\n\nI don't encourage,\n0:08:52 – 0:08:54\n\nbecause I think,\n0:08:54 – 0:08:56\n\nlike I am in that school,\n0:08:56 – 0:08:58\n\nI think, if we get into more technology,\n0:08:58 – 0:09:00\n\nthen the generations will get spoiled,\n0:09:00 – 0:09:02\n\nI understand that.\n0:09:02 – 0:09:04\n\nAnd plus, I get briefs,\n0:09:04 – 0:09:06\n\nthe briefs of big events,\n0:09:06 – 0:09:08\n\nI do not disturb them,\n0:09:08 – 0:09:10\n\nthey do brainstorming,\n0:09:10 – 0:09:12\n\nI listen to them,\n0:09:12 – 0:09:14\n\nthen we develop,\n0:09:14 – 0:09:16\n\nI don't know why,\n0:09:16 – 0:09:18\n\nbut I think,\n0:09:18 – 0:09:20\n\nwhen I put everything into technology,\n0:09:20 – 0:09:22\n\nthen our SMC group,\n0:09:22 – 0:09:24\n\nwe are a very creative agency,\n0:09:24 – 0:09:26\n\nour business gets the greatest results.\n0:09:26 – 0:09:28\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:09:28 – 0:09:30\n\nSo, I think,\n0:09:30 – 0:09:32\n\npeople are saying this,\n0:09:32 – 0:09:34\n\nbut we have not started yet,\n0:09:34 – 0:09:36\n\nwe should use tools,\n0:09:36 – 0:09:38\n\nlike we use phones,\n0:09:38 – 0:09:40\n\nor like we use pens,\n0:09:40 – 0:09:42\n\nwe should not use it in such a way,\n0:09:42 – 0:09:44\n\nthat if someone gives it to you, you give it back.\n0:09:44 – 0:09:46\n\nThis will never happen.\n0:09:46 – 0:09:48\n\nIn terms of creative, this will never happen.\n0:09:48 – 0:09:50\n\nSo, that's why I am telling you,\n0:09:50 – 0:09:52\n\nwe use Dalai for pictures,\n0:09:52 – 0:09:54\n\nwe edit that and use it in BPD,\n0:09:54 – 0:09:56\n\nas of now.\n0:09:56 – 0:09:58\n\nOkay.\n0:09:58 – 0:10:00\n\nNow, this is one part.\n0:10:00 – 0:10:02\n\nSecond, as I told you,\n0:10:02 – 0:10:04\n\nI tried to do research,\n0:10:04 – 0:10:06\n\nso I realized that\n0:10:06 – 0:10:08\n\nin the past year,\n0:10:08 – 0:10:10\n\nall the inquiries\n0:10:10 – 0:10:12\n\nthat come,\n0:10:12 – 0:10:14\n\nif all the inquiries start working,\n0:10:14 – 0:10:16\n\nthen I don't know where their profit will go,\n0:10:16 – 0:10:18\n\nbut in half the time, the inquiry is completed,\n0:10:18 – 0:10:20\n\nin half the time, the reply never went,\n0:10:20 – 0:10:22\n\nsometimes the reply went, so the follow-up didn't happen,\n0:10:22 – 0:10:24\n\nsometimes the event happened, so the follow-up didn't happen,\n0:10:24 – 0:10:26\n\nthey couldn't give the feedback,\n0:10:26 – 0:10:28\n\nhow does all that manage?\n0:10:28 – 0:10:30\n\nSee, I told you that\n0:10:30 – 0:10:34\n\nwe don't do business development,\n0:10:34 – 0:10:38\n\nbecause we don't have time, number one.\n0:10:38 – 0:10:40\n\nThe reason is that\n0:10:40 – 0:10:42\n\nI get repative work,\n0:10:42 – 0:10:44\n\nand we can't do the same with Bhuvan.\n0:10:44 – 0:10:46\n\nNumber two,\n0:10:46 – 0:10:48\n\nthe event veterans.com\n0:10:48 – 0:10:50\n\nthat you saw,\n0:10:50 – 0:10:52\n\nwe have made it\n0:10:52 – 0:10:54\n\npicture by picture,\n0:10:54 – 0:10:56\n\nbecause the client asks us\n0:10:56 – 0:10:58\n\nfor the picture of their event,\n0:10:58 – 0:11:00\n\nI can't give them that,\n0:11:00 – 0:11:02\n\nso I told the guys to make a website,\n0:11:02 – 0:11:04\n\nwhich we will sell online,\n0:11:04 – 0:11:06\n\nand in that,\n0:11:06 – 0:11:08\n\nlike exclusive,\n0:11:08 – 0:11:10\n\nwe won't put the work of BJP,\n0:11:10 – 0:11:12\n\nwe won't put the work of Indian Army,\n0:11:12 – 0:11:14\n\nwe will put the work of Indian Navy,\n0:11:14 – 0:11:16\n\nso that we can get work online,\n0:11:16 – 0:11:18\n\nso that we can get work online,\n0:11:18 – 0:11:20\n\nsince we started promoting online,\n0:11:20 – 0:11:22\n\nI have stopped it,\n0:11:22 – 0:11:24\n\nwe started advertisement,\n0:11:24 – 0:11:26\n\nwe started advertising,\n0:11:26 – 0:11:28\n\nwe started advertising,\n0:11:28 – 0:11:30\n\nand that was our time waste,\n0:11:30 – 0:11:32\n\nlet me tell you the reason.\n0:11:32 – 0:11:34\n\nThe reason is,\n0:11:34 – 0:11:36\n\nI won't say a big thing,\n0:11:36 – 0:11:38\n\nbut we are a big agency,\n0:11:38 – 0:11:40\n\nwe can't do Chindi's event,\n0:11:40 – 0:11:42\n\nso we started getting calls from Chindis,\n0:11:42 – 0:11:44\n\nso we started getting calls from Chindis,\n0:11:44 – 0:11:46\n\nand the calls from Chindis,\n0:11:46 – 0:11:48\n\nthere are two types of people coming,\n0:11:48 – 0:11:50\n\nthere are HR heads coming,\n0:11:50 – 0:11:52\n\nwho have never done any event,\n0:11:52 – 0:11:54\n\nso they came to us and said,\n0:11:54 – 0:11:56\n\nlet's do the event,\n0:11:56 – 0:11:58\n\nnow when we tell our budget,\n0:11:58 – 0:12:00\n\nthen my son's travel is also in it,\n0:12:00 – 0:12:02\n\nso if my son's travel is 20 days,\n0:12:02 – 0:12:04\n\nno, I am expensive,\n0:12:04 – 0:12:06\n\nwe put our travel money in taxi,\n0:12:06 – 0:12:08\n\nif I come for a meeting,\n0:12:08 – 0:12:10\n\nno, the company doesn't put it,\n0:12:10 – 0:12:12\n\nso 15% is our NCPs,\n0:12:12 – 0:12:14\n\nso 15% is our NCPs,\n0:12:14 – 0:12:16\n\nso 15% is our NCPs,\n0:12:16 – 0:12:18\n\nso what was happening,\n0:12:18 – 0:12:20\n\nwe won't do any event,\n0:12:20 – 0:12:22\n\nso what was happening,\n0:12:22 – 0:12:24\n\nwe started getting calls for 2-2 lakhs,\n0:12:24 – 0:12:26\n\nI said, brother, we don't have much time,\n0:12:26 – 0:12:28\n\nI had kept it for my son,\n0:12:28 – 0:12:30\n\nso we said, brother, we don't have much time,\n0:12:30 – 0:12:32\n\nstop the ads, we don't have much time,\n0:12:32 – 0:12:34\n\nand they were tight gazing at our news,\n0:12:34 – 0:12:36\n\nso that's why we stopped that work,\n0:12:36 – 0:12:38\n\nnow by the grace of God,\n0:12:38 – 0:12:40\n\nour work is going on,\n0:12:40 – 0:12:42\n\nbut we had made a website till now,\n0:12:42 – 0:12:44\n\nto see that it comes online,\n0:12:44 – 0:12:46\n\nso that's why,\n0:12:46 – 0:12:48\n\nbut we get it internationally,\n0:12:48 – 0:12:50\n\nthere is a place in Canada,\n0:12:50 – 0:12:52\n\nOntario,\n0:12:52 – 0:12:54\n\nthey come to the Ontario mission, India,\n0:12:54 – 0:12:56\n\nso for 3 months,\n0:12:56 – 0:12:58\n\nthey book Taj or Oberoi,\n0:12:58 – 0:13:00\n\nthey make 20-25 rooms,\n0:13:00 – 0:13:02\n\nwe do that exclusively,\n0:13:02 – 0:13:04\n\nso that's why we like such events,\n0:13:04 – 0:13:06\n\nbecause they give money to talk on the phone,\n0:13:06 – 0:13:08\n\nour company,\n0:13:08 – 0:13:10\n\nso if you are talking,\n0:13:10 – 0:13:12\n\nthey give you $9 per hour to talk,\n0:13:12 – 0:13:14\n\nso that's good,\n0:13:14 – 0:13:16\n\nso we have activated it to pitch,\n0:13:16 – 0:13:18\n\nso that it works,\n0:13:18 – 0:13:20\n\nbut in India, I think it's Chindi,\n0:13:20 – 0:13:22\n\nhe can suit the one who has opened a new company,\n0:13:22 – 0:13:24\n\nand he is learning,\n0:13:24 – 0:13:26\n\nthat he can do an event of 2 lakhs,\n0:13:26 – 0:13:28\n\nI think he is working for us,\n0:13:28 – 0:13:30\n\nnot for us,\n0:13:30 – 0:13:32\n\nso that's why,\n0:13:32 – 0:13:34\n\nmy answer was,\n0:13:34 – 0:13:36\n\nthe question was,\n0:13:36 – 0:13:38\n\nwe don't just do it,\n0:13:38 – 0:13:40\n\nwhatever we do,\n0:13:40 – 0:13:42\n\nit suits, like there is a company,\n0:13:42 – 0:13:44\n\nI don't know the name of the company,\n0:13:44 – 0:13:46\n\nI don't know the name of the company,\n0:13:46 – 0:13:48\n\nso I am the official event manager\n0:13:48 – 0:13:50\n\nfor Leela Gurdwara and Hyatt Manager,\n0:13:50 – 0:13:52\n\nif you go there, I will get a call,\n0:13:52 – 0:13:54\n\nso,\n0:13:54 – 0:13:56\n\nthe company,\n0:13:56 – 0:13:58\n\nthey have told us,\n0:13:58 – 0:14:00\n\nwe need this, we need that,\n0:14:00 – 0:14:02\n\nwe have put a lot of effort,\n0:14:02 – 0:14:04\n\nwe are also doing a good job,\n0:14:04 – 0:14:06\n\nwe have given them a budget of 1 crore,\n0:14:06 – 0:14:08\n\nwe have a budget of 10 lakhs,\n0:14:08 – 0:14:10\n\nso I told them,\n0:14:10 – 0:14:12\n\nwe have a budget of 10 lakhs,\n0:14:12 – 0:14:14\n\nso they have spoiled our whole month,\n0:14:14 – 0:14:16\n\n30 days,\n0:14:16 – 0:14:18\n\nand then we have given up,\n0:14:18 – 0:14:20\n\nso that inquiry came from Hyatt,\n0:14:20 – 0:14:22\n\nso I couldn't say anything to them,\n0:14:22 – 0:14:24\n\nI told them, it's okay,\n0:14:24 – 0:14:26\n\nso this happens,\n0:14:26 – 0:14:28\n\nso we miss ourselves,\n0:14:28 – 0:14:30\n\nso nowadays,\n0:14:30 – 0:14:32\n\nlike my senior manager,\n0:14:32 – 0:14:34\n\nwho I take from life,\n0:14:34 – 0:14:36\n\nfor 2-3 years,\n0:14:36 – 0:14:38\n\nbecause I have increased my level,\n0:14:38 – 0:14:40\n\nafter that,\n0:14:40 – 0:14:42\n\nif someone works for us for 3 years,\n0:14:42 – 0:14:44\n\nthen he becomes a cheetah,\n0:14:44 – 0:14:46\n\nokay,\n0:14:46 – 0:14:48\n\nso if I start giving cheetah costs to cheetahs,\n0:14:48 – 0:14:50\n\nthen I will become a cheetah,\n0:14:50 – 0:14:52\n\nso then I release them,\n0:14:52 – 0:14:54\n\nso what they do,\n0:14:54 – 0:14:56\n\nthey open their own companies,\n0:14:56 – 0:14:58\n\nthey think they are alive,\n0:14:58 – 0:15:00\n\nI can't complete their costs,\n0:15:00 – 0:15:02\n\nso,\n0:15:02 – 0:15:04\n\nas you said,\n0:15:04 – 0:15:06\n\nan inquiry came,\n0:15:06 – 0:15:08\n\nand then they say,\n0:15:08 – 0:15:10\n\nso I tell them decently,\n0:15:10 – 0:15:12\n\nthat I can't go below this,\n0:15:12 – 0:15:14\n\nif you want me to do, then do,\n0:15:14 – 0:15:16\n\nso in many of my events,\n0:15:16 – 0:15:18\n\nthis happens,\n0:15:18 – 0:15:20\n\nmy employees tell me,\n0:15:20 – 0:15:22\n\nthat my clients have gone,\n0:15:22 – 0:15:24\n\nso my old employees,\n0:15:24 – 0:15:26\n\nthey are also sitting there,\n0:15:26 – 0:15:28\n\nthey have come to meet,\n0:15:28 – 0:15:30\n\nso this is it,\n0:15:30 – 0:15:32\n\nso to answer your question,\n0:15:32 – 0:15:34\n\nwe will leave the work,\n0:15:34 – 0:15:36\n\nif you know that it's not happening,\n0:15:36 – 0:15:38\n\nso the answer that I got was,\n0:15:38 – 0:15:40\n\nthere is not that much push in marketing,\n0:15:40 – 0:15:42\n\nnor is there that much,\n0:15:42 – 0:15:44\n\nwe pay more attention to the repeat business,\n0:15:44 – 0:15:46\n\nso we don't need that much,\n0:15:46 – 0:15:48\n\nbut after the event,\n0:15:48 – 0:15:50\n\nyour feedbacks,\n0:15:50 – 0:15:52\n\nthat how good it was, how bad it was,\n0:15:52 – 0:15:54\n\nwhat was right, what was wrong,\n0:15:54 – 0:15:56\n\nthat still has to be done,\n0:15:56 – 0:15:58\n\nwe just do a debriefing meeting,\n0:15:58 – 0:16:00\n\nwhen you tell us your mistake,\n0:16:00 – 0:16:02\n\ngenerally we don't do it,\n0:16:02 – 0:16:04\n\nwe don't do it,\n0:16:04 – 0:16:06\n\nmy employees,\n0:16:06 – 0:16:08\n\nI don't think they do any mistake,\n0:16:08 – 0:16:10\n\nI don't think they do any mistake,\n0:16:10 – 0:16:12\n\nbut do we get feedbacks from somewhere,\n0:16:12 – 0:16:14\n\ndo we catch or not?\n0:16:14 – 0:16:16\n\ngenerally no, we are very good,\n0:16:16 – 0:16:18\n\nI mean,\n0:16:18 – 0:16:20\n\nour process is only work,\n0:16:20 – 0:16:22\n\nour work can be wrong,\n0:16:22 – 0:16:24\n\nbecause we deal only with top vendors,\n0:16:24 – 0:16:26\n\nof India,\n0:16:26 – 0:16:28\n\nthe equipment will come from top dealers,\n0:16:28 – 0:16:30\n\nthe LED will not go anywhere,\n0:16:30 – 0:16:32\n\nwhatever sound you make,\n0:16:32 – 0:16:34\n\nthe JBL, JBL will not go anywhere,\n0:16:34 – 0:16:36\n\nit will be right from the top,\n0:16:36 – 0:16:38\n\nso the equipment is different,\n0:16:38 – 0:16:40\n\nthe people are different,\n0:16:40 – 0:16:42\n\nthat's why we are expensive,\n0:16:42 – 0:16:44\n\nso that's it.\n0:16:44 – 0:16:46\n\nand the third segment\n0:16:46 – 0:16:48\n\ncomes of process management,\n0:16:48 – 0:16:50\n\nthe process is going on,\n0:16:50 – 0:16:52\n\nthere are 100 people sitting,\n0:16:52 – 0:16:54\n\nsomeone is running here, someone is running there,\n0:16:54 – 0:16:56\n\nno one's work is done,\n0:16:56 – 0:16:58\n\nwe need someone to follow up,\n0:16:58 – 0:17:00\n\ndo we use AI in that or not?\n0:17:00 – 0:17:02\n\nNo,\n0:17:02 – 0:17:04\n\nit's a very dangerous business,\n0:17:04 – 0:17:06\n\nI don't know about my agency,\n0:17:06 – 0:17:08\n\nif you do production,\n0:17:08 – 0:17:10\n\nthen you will only do production,\n0:17:10 – 0:17:12\n\nif someone says to you,\n0:17:12 – 0:17:14\n\ndo one thing, buy this or that,\n0:17:14 – 0:17:16\n\nyou will not bring it, you will not do marketing,\n0:17:16 – 0:17:18\n\nor if someone says to you,\n0:17:18 – 0:17:20\n\nthis is creative, you can do it,\n0:17:20 – 0:17:22\n\nI am busy, let's change this,\n0:17:22 – 0:17:24\n\nso we pay a lot of attention\n0:17:24 – 0:17:26\n\nto this,\n0:17:26 – 0:17:28\n\nlike I said,\n0:17:28 – 0:17:30\n\nnobody enters the company at 12 o'clock,\n0:17:30 – 0:17:32\n\nI let him come at 12 o'clock,\n0:17:32 – 0:17:34\n\nbecause I think\n0:17:34 – 0:17:36\n\nif he stays happy, then only he will be able to work properly,\n0:17:36 – 0:17:38\n\nin my case,\n0:17:38 – 0:17:40\n\neven if someone gets a job\n0:17:40 – 0:17:42\n\nafter a month,\n0:17:42 – 0:17:44\n\nI know he will come back,\n0:17:44 – 0:17:46\n\nbecause he can't come,\n0:17:46 – 0:17:48\n\nhe won't be able to do any other work,\n0:17:48 – 0:17:50\n\nbecause he won't find it easy like us,\n0:17:50 – 0:17:52\n\ndo you understand?\n0:17:52 – 0:17:54\n\nSo that's why,\n0:17:54 – 0:17:56\n\nI forgot something,\n0:17:56 – 0:17:58\n\nwhat was the question?\n0:17:58 – 0:18:00\n\nTo manage the process,\n0:18:00 – 0:18:02\n\nwhat I have done is,\n0:18:02 – 0:18:04\n\nI have split the department,\n0:18:04 – 0:18:06\n\nand whoever does it,\n0:18:06 – 0:18:08\n\nhe does it, he doesn't get angry,\n0:18:08 – 0:18:10\n\nlike in the tunes,\n0:18:10 – 0:18:12\n\nif someone\n0:18:12 – 0:18:14\n\ndoes production\n0:18:14 – 0:18:16\n\nin a meeting,\n0:18:16 – 0:18:18\n\nand if someone gets an answer,\n0:18:18 – 0:18:20\n\nhe won't open it in the meeting,\n0:18:20 – 0:18:22\n\nin the meeting,\n0:18:22 – 0:18:24\n\nthe person of the operation will open it,\n0:18:24 – 0:18:26\n\nand if the client requests too much,\n0:18:26 – 0:18:28\n\nthen he will call,\n0:18:28 – 0:18:30\n\neven if it's a fake call,\n0:18:30 – 0:18:32\n\nhe will ask and tell,\n0:18:32 – 0:18:34\n\nso we don't have any request,\n0:18:34 – 0:18:36\n\nfor the process,\n0:18:36 – 0:18:38\n\nwe just touch it,\n0:18:38 – 0:18:40\n\ntouch it,\n0:18:40 – 0:18:42\n\nwe are Indian Army's\n0:18:42 – 0:18:44\n\nofficial

People want it everywhere. Their stories are different. Their sorrows are different.\n0:31:34 – 0:31:43\n\nBecause everyone's sorrows are different depending on what they want to do.\n0:31:43 – 0:31:47\n\nOkay.\n0:31:47 – 0:31:48\n\nOkay, so your view was very different.\n0:31:48 – 0:31:52\n\nLet me tell you something. We go to EMA. In EMA…brother, I called a guy at the wedding. He came from Italy only to take care of chandelier.\n0:31:52 – 0:32:05\n\nHow to make chandelier for people.\n0:32:05 – 0:32:08\n\nSo, I have to say that it is not like we are a discussion portal.\n0:32:08 – 0:32:13\n\nWe had called industry experts of AIQ and people showed very good participation.\n0:32:13 – 0:32:18\n\nI mean, people were very happy. And nowadays, people are very fond of FOMO.\n0:32:18 – 0:32:23\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:32:23 – 0:32:24\n\nThey are going to get a one-hour session in which they will get to know what is happening in AI.\n0:32:24 – 0:32:29\n\nHalf of the people don't know how AI will benefit the business.\n0:32:29 – 0:32:33\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:32:33 – 0:32:34\n\nWe know how it is doing for us. But we are not happy because we don't get to take the responsibility.\n0:32:34 – 0:32:39\n\nToday, if we make a software, Vicky, it will say that the event management company will go there and say that this is the FOMO.\n0:32:39 – 0:32:48\n\nAnd it will say that you will press this button, you will get a gift, you will press this button.\n0:32:48 – 0:32:52\n\nIt will discuss the market and give you the cost.\n0:32:52 – 0:32:55\n\nYou will press this button. You won't get this vendor in this country, in this city.\n0:32:55 – 0:32:59\n\nYou will press this button here. You will get its number.\n0:32:59 – 0:33:01\n\nYou will get a disaster. Do you understand? Because I think AI doesn't know what I have studied.\n0:33:01 – 0:33:09\n\nI have studied, but I don't know what I have studied.\n0:33:09 – 0:33:11\n\nBut from what I have studied, I have understood that we don't know anything about AI.\n0:33:11 – 0:33:18\n\nWe are just guessing.\n0:33:18 – 0:33:20\n\nI mean, we, not you, but the normal people.\n0:33:20 – 0:33:24\n\nToday we will get to know from our media that there is a vendor of AI who will press the button and improve our world.\n0:33:24 – 0:33:31\n\nI will buy it. Or I will take its subscription.\n0:33:31 – 0:33:34\n\nOr I will buy it for the year.\n0:33:34 – 0:33:36\n\nIf you teach me, then at least teach me a tuition.\n0:33:36 – 0:33:39\n\nI don't know how to use AI.\n0:33:39 – 0:33:41\n\nI think AI is the biggest robot.\n0:33:41 – 0:33:43\n\nNo, I understand.\n0:33:43 – 0:33:44\n\nRight? Yes.\n0:33:44 – 0:33:46\n\nAnd this is also right. Because like we have done research for it, it is for 65. So we got to learn a lot about the industry.\n0:33:46 – 0:33:55\n\nHow is it going? What is going on?\n0:33:55 – 0:33:56\n\nIn the back, they also invited me. What was its name? The one that was shown to Brian Adams.\n0:33:56 – 0:34:01\n\nYes.\n0:34:01 – 0:34:02\n\nSo I went there too. I saw what they do first hand. How do they do it? What was going on?\n0:34:02 – 0:34:07\n\nInteresting. Very interesting industry.\n0:34:07 – 0:34:09\n\nBut you know, the layman that you see, you see only that. You see the operation and say that there are events.\n0:34:09 – 0:34:19\n\nThe event doesn't happen. The event happens 45 days before that.\n0:34:19 – 0:34:25\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n0:34:25 – 0:34:27\n\nRight? And that happens so much. People say that it is getting old and you do it once and you sleep for 8 hours.\n0:34:27 – 0:34:34\n\nNo, I agree. I have seen it.\n0:34:34 – 0:34:36\n\nYes. There is so much effort in this work. And there are so many rejects. And it is a thankless job.\n0:34:36 – 0:34:43\n\nAbsolutely.\n0:34:43 – 0:34:44\n\nIf I do 100 events, then 10-11% of the clients will call us on stage and say that we would like to thank CRI events and events veterans and Sumeet Khanna and anybody.\n0:34:44 – 0:34:54\n\nReason being because they have to earn numbers in front of their seniors. So the event manager will always be at the back foot.\n0:34:54 – 0:35:01\n\nNo one comes to the stage. We all work hard. So the thing is that if the margin is very good, then you ignore it.\n0:35:01 – 0:35:10\n\nBut at the end of the day, it is a thankless job. There is a lot of margin and there is a lot.\n0:35:10 – 0:35:15\n\nAnd the margin is also good because you have caught the niche. Because these small people are not getting anything. They are crying by catching the margin.\n0:35:15 – 0:35:22\n\nNo, we don't do it. I am telling you seriously. We are number one and the person who is at number 2 in daily NCR is at number 10.\n0:35:22 – 0:35:31\n\nThere is no doubt in it. I also come to this number one meeting that if a new person says that you are human, then we are number one and the person who is at number 2 is at number 10.\n0:35:31 – 0:35:41\n\nAnd if you have a wrong opinion, then come and see. This is what I tell them. And my employees generally don't leave Vicky because the environment is such that I don't allow guys to till 10 lakh rupees to buy a car with a loan.\n0:35:41 – 0:36:02\n\nI give them an advance. What happens in that is that they close. No, one of them has an insurance. Basically, what happens is that he is saying that he has an insurance. He is not interested.\n0:36:02 – 0:36:15\n\nAnd the other thing is that these small people, like I give them holidays, I take good care of them. So that if I am sleeping at 3 o'clock in the night, then I don't get a call.\n0:36:15 – 0:36:25\n\nBut you tell me one thing that you are saying that their life is 3.5-4 years and they can't survive more than that.\n0:36:25 – 0:36:34\n\nNo, I am only doing client servicing. I am not going to do production, promotion, creative. The client service person thinks that I am just doing something. I am doing the fitting. I am doing this from the client. I know that I will get the production done from there.\n0:36:34 – 0:36:56\n\nI will get the light done from there. The artist is in my gym. Then he thinks that why am I not doing that? Then he leaves. And I cut his cake and do it because he comes back after 3 months.\n0:36:56 – 0:37:07\n\nNo, no, there are a lot of things. They don't even know about it. They don't know. When they have to pay the vendor, they understand what is happening.\n0:37:07 – 0:37:16\n\nThey think that the vendor needs to pay the vendor. I used to work with Vodafone. Vodafone is all over East India. Now Vodafone is merged with Idea.\n0:37:16 – 0:37:31\n\nSo what I used to do is that I used to mail to the business head and we used to work on it. We used to work on the mail. Now what happened is that they got the golden handshake.\n0:37:31 – 0:37:45\n\nThey got the golden handshake and they got a 6 month salary. When this got merged, Vodafone got 3 business heads, one from Quartique, one from Kolkata and one from Bombay. They got the golden handshake. They got the golden handshake and they got a 6 month salary and they said to leave it immediately.\n0:37:45 – 0:38:00\n\nWe have been doing business with their mail. We have made 80 lakh rupees. No one is going to speak. No one is going to ask. Nothing has happened.\n0:38:00 – 0:38:09\n\nSo, new companies are not going to do it. There are many hidden things like this. So, people think, client servicing people think that we will do it. They are not able to do it.\n0:38:09 – 0:38:19\n\nSo, client servicing people take 3-4 years.\n0:38:19 – 0:38:21\n\nBut, other people are with you in the long term?\n0:38:21 – 0:38:23\n\nNo one is going to do the rest of the work. They are doing the same thing with their children. What happens to the production people? They wake up at night and go to sleep in the morning.\n0:38:24 – 0:38:32\n\nProduction is done at night. Production people work with carpenters, workers. When there are commotion people, they work with the police. They work with the people of the market.\n0:38:32 – 0:38:42\n\nSo, in their life, there is a lot of stress. So, they don't have to take 3-4 years. Plus, we give them so much salary every night that they don't get a chance to complain. Do you understand?\n0:38:42 – 0:38:52\n\nYes. I didn't take a single penny out of the whole pandemic. We gave salary for 6 months and then we gave Rs.4000 for the next 6 months.\n0:38:53 – 0:39:01\n\nAt first, we had to pay Rs.12,500 for Big Bazaar. We had to pay Rs.11,000. We had to invest Rs.12,500.\n0:39:01 – 0:39:08\n\nAt the end of the pandemic, I told my kids that our Nassir was closed. Kejriwal said that 50 people won't come from there. So, we had to sit at home. So, my life was ruined.\n0:39:09 – 0:39:21\n\nEven then, we had to pay for Big Bazaar. We were like, Panky, we are not giving you food. You can take this. You can work.\n0:39:21 – 0:39:26\n\nSo, I still remember my son's loyalty. I had given him the money to sell gold. Do you understand?\n0:39:26 – 0:39:34\n\nYes. He is loyal. We are client servicing people. We are client servicing people. We can see what is in their eyes. That's why they left.\n0:39:35 – 0:39:42\n\nI understand. I understand. But, I have noticed that not only client servicing, but they couldn't manage there. Because their production people are running away.\n0:39:42 – 0:39:51\n\nOther people are running away. They are also running away. They are trying to start their own business by running away.\n0:39:51 – 0:39:56\n\nSee, the production head, the production supervisor, he will run away. He will run away because he will feel that he is his own production company.\n0:39:57 – 0:40:07\n\nHe will run away. It is difficult for him to get a job somewhere else.\n0:40:07 – 0:40:13\n\nA production person is not a hero. If a client gets 50, he will give one. If a production person gets 50, he will give 60. He will not give 70.\n0:40:14 – 0:40:27\n\nSo, he can start his own business. Yes, he will run away if he starts his own business.\n0:40:27 – 0:40:32\n\nHe has the right to start his own business. That's why he will run away.\n0:40:32 – 0:40:37\n\nMake sense. Make sense. Interesting.\n0:40:38 – 0:40:44\n\nNo, no. It is interesting. The more I understand your industry, the more interesting it is.\n0:40:44 – 0:40:49\n\nWe have a benefit in technology. Do you know what is the benefit?\n0:40:49 – 0:40:52\n\nAll industries tell us what we do when we are naked.\n0:40:52 – 0:40:56\n\nWhether it is food, soap, manufacturing factory, or events. Because we cannot help them until they are open to us.\n0:40:57 – 0:41:08\n\nCorrect. So, what do you do basically?\n0:41:08 – 0:41:11\n\nI am a technology consultant. Wherever there is any work related to technology, I help them deliver it. That's my job.\n0:41:11 – 0:41:25\n\nIf something happens tomorrow, I will call you.\n0:41:26 – 0:41:28\n\nAnytime. You can call me anytime.\n0:41:28 – 0:41:31\n\nOkay. No, it is good. It is good. It is very good.\n0:41:31 – 0:41:35\n\nSo, you understand that when nobody understands what needs to be done in technology, he calls you. It is simple.\n0:41:35 – 0:41:42\n\nYes, I understand.\n0:41:42 – 0:41:44\n\nCome tomorrow. We will sit together.\n0:41:44 – 0:41:48\n\nWe will plan it after today.\n0:41:48 – 0:41:50\n\nWhenever you are coming, call me. I will be around 31. I will be there for a few days.\n0:41:50 – 0:41:54\n\nWow!\n0:41:55 – 0:41:56\n\nI am telling you that they have donated mothi. I am also okay with that.\n0:41:56 – 0:42:02\n\nBut, those people can't go to Dehradun.\n0:42:02 – 0:42:05\n\nDehradun's situation is not the same. If my parents are not there, I won't go either.\n0:42:05 – 0:42:09\n\nAbsolutely correct.\n0:42:09 – 0:42:11\n\nWhen a person goes to rewind, he gets stressed.\n0:42:11 – 0:42:15\n\nHe gets stressed badly.\n0:42:15 – 0:42:17\n\nI mean, a person can't leave with a car till evening.\n0:42:17 – 0:42:20\n\nCorrect. Absolutely.\n0:42:20 – 0:42:22\n\nSo, I spend time with my parents.\n0:42:22 – 0:42:24\n\nWhich one?\n0:42:25 – 0:42:26\n\nThe 2-hour road is not going to open for 2-2.5 hours.\n0:42:26 – 0:42:28\n\nIt is not going to open for an hour. And nobody is going to reach there in 2 hours.\n0:42:28 – 0:42:31\n\nThat's true. You are in a car like a coffin.\n0:42:31 – 0:42:34\n\nYou are in a car like a coffin.\n0:42:34 – 0:42:36\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:36 – 0:42:40\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:40 – 0:42:42\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:42 – 0:42:44\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:44 – 0:42:46\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:46 – 0:42:48\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:48 – 0:42:50\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:50 – 0:42:52\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:52 – 0:42:54\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:55 – 0:42:56\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:56 – 0:42:58\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:42:58 – 0:43:00\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:00 – 0:43:02\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:02 – 0:43:04\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:04 – 0:43:06\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:06 – 0:43:08\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:08 – 0:43:10\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:10 – 0:43:12\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:12 – 0:43:14\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:14 – 0:43:16\n\nI drive the green one. It is clean. There are no big holes.\n0:43:16 – 0:43:18\n\nThank you for watching the video.\n0:43:19 – 0:43:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Research Questions\n\nIndustry and Sector: What industry does the company operate in?\nEvent - CRI Events - No ATL Ads = \nCompany Size: What is the size of the company in terms of employees and revenue?\n151  50\nAI Adoption Level: Has the company started adopting AI technologies, and where are we so far?\n$20 2 emp\nDalle - Design - PPT\nBrief - Creative Date - Presentation - Seriousness/Relebvnce - PPT Production - Share - Ops - vet\n\nStory teller - AV Ads - \n\nSpecific AI Projects: What specific generative AI projects has the company undertaken?\nStrategic Goals: What are the company's strategic goals that seem like they can benefit from AI?\nPast Achievements: What has the company already achieved with generative AI, and how have you handled challenges in various areas (Technology Infrastructure, People, Data, Processes, Culture, Operations)?\nFuture Plans: If done right, how can AI or generative AI affect the company's future plans?\n\n\nTailored Interview Questions\n\n1.
